      Description: Alembic is a database migrations tool written by the authorof `SQLAlchemy
        <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_.  A migrations tooloffers the following functionality:*
        Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change  the structure
        of tables and other constructs* Provides a system whereby "migration scripts"
        may be constructed;  each script indicates a particular series of steps that
        can "upgrade" a  target database to a new version, and optionally a series
        of steps that can  "downgrade" similarly, doing the same steps in reverse.*
        Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.The goals of Alembic
        are:* Very open ended and transparent configuration and operation.   A new  Alembic
        environment is generated from a set of templates which is selected  among
        a set of options when setup first occurs. The templates then deposit a  series
        of scripts that define fully how database connectivity is established  and
        how migration scripts are invoked; the migration scripts themselves are  generated
        from a template within that series of scripts. The scripts can  then be further
        customized to define exactly how databases will be  interacted with and what
        structure new migration files should take.* Full support for transactional
        DDL.   The default scripts ensure that all  migrations occur within a transaction
        - for those databases which support  this (Postgresql, Microsoft SQL Server),
        migrations can be tested with no  need to manually undo changes upon failure.*
        Minimalist script construction.  Basic operations like renaming  tables/columns,
        adding/removing columns, changing column attributes can be  performed through
        one line commands like alter_column(), rename_table(),  add_constraint().
        There is no need to recreate full SQLAlchemy Table  structures for simple
        operations like these - the functions themselves  generate minimalist schema
        structures behind the scenes to achieve the given  DDL sequence.* "auto generation"
        of migrations. While real world migrations are far more  complex than what
        can be automatically determined, Alembic can still  eliminate the initial
        grunt work in generating new migration directives  from an altered schema.  The
        ``--autogenerate`` feature will inspect the  current status of a database
        using SQLAlchemy's schema inspection  capabilities, compare it to the current
        state of the database model as  specified in Python, and generate a series
        of "candidate" migrations,  rendering them into a new migration script as
        Python directives. The  developer then edits the new file, adding additional
        directives and data  migrations as needed, to produce a finished migration.
        Table and column  level changes can be detected, with constraints and indexes
        to follow as  well.* Full support for migrations generated as SQL scripts.   Those
        of us who  work in corporate environments know that direct access to DDL commands
        on a  production database is a rare privilege, and DBAs want textual SQL scripts.  Alembic's
        usage model and commands are oriented towards being able to run a  series
        of migrations into a textual output file as easily as it runs them  directly
        to a database. Care must be taken in this mode to not invoke other  operations
        that rely upon in-memory SELECTs of rows - Alembic tries to  provide helper
        constructs like bulk_insert() to help with data-oriented  operations that
        are compatible with script-based DDL.* Non-linear, dependency-graph versioning.   Scripts
        are given UUID  identifiers similarly to a DVCS, and the linkage of one script
        to the next  is achieved via human-editable markers within the scripts themselves.  The
        structure of a set of migration files is considered as a  directed-acyclic
        graph, meaning any migration file can be dependent  on any other arbitrary
        set of migration files, or none at  all.  Through this open-ended system,
        migration files can be organized  into branches, multiple roots, and mergepoints,
        without restriction.  Commands are provided to produce new branches, roots,
        and merges of  branches automatically.* Provide a library of ALTER constructs
        that can be used by any SQLAlchemy  application. The DDL constructs build
        upon SQLAlchemy's own DDLElement base  and can be used standalone by any application
        or script.* At long last, bring SQLite and its inability to ALTER things into
        the fold,  but in such a way that SQLite's very special workflow needs are
        accommodated  in an explicit way that makes the most of a bad situation, through
        the  concept of a "batch" migration, where multiple changes to a table can  be
        batched together to form a series of instructions for a single, subsequent  "move-and-copy"
        workflow.   You can even use "move-and-copy" workflow for  other databases,
        if you want to recreate a table in the background  on a busy system.Documentation

        4, 5), datetime.date(1981, 3, 6))Notice that the result of the above parse
        is not in order from earliest to latest. If sorted intervals are required,
        simply use the :code:`sorted` keyword as shown below::  >>> sorted(aniso8601.parse_interval(''P1M/1981-04-05''))  [datetime.date(1981,
        3, 6), datetime.date(1981, 4, 5)]The end of an interval is returned as a datetime
        when required to maintain the resolution specified by a duration, even if
        the duration start is given as a date::  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval(''2014-11-12/PT4H54M6.5S'')  (datetime.date(2014,
        11, 12), datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 12, 4, 54, 6, 500000))  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval(''2007-03-01/P1.5D'')  (datetime.date(2007,

        can be used to change the output format of a parse operation. All parse functions
        have a :code:`builder` keyword argument which accepts a builder class.Two
        builders are included. The :code:`PythonTimeBuilder` (the default) in the
        :code:`aniso8601.builders.python` module, and the :code:`TupleBuilder` which
        returns the parse result as a corresponding named tuple and is located in
        the :code:`aniso8601.builders` module.Information on writing a builder can
        be found in `BUILDERS </BUILDERS.rst>`_.The following builders are available
        as separate projects:* `RelativeTimeBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/relativetimebuilder>`_
        supports parsing to `datetutil relativedelta types <https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/relativedelta.html>`_
        for calendar level accuracy* `AttoTimeBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/attotimebuilder>`_
        supports parsing directly to `attotime attodatetime and attotimedelta types
        <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/attotime>`_ which support sub-nanosecond precision*
        `NumPyTimeBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/numpytimebuilder>`_ supports
        parsing directly to `NumPy datetime64 and timedelta64 types <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.datetime.html>`_TupleBuilder------------The
        :code:`TupleBuilder` returns parse results as `named tuples <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple>`_.
        It is located in the :code:`aniso8601.builders` module.Datetimes^^^^^^^^^Parsing
        a datetime returns a :code:`DatetimeTuple` containing :code:`Date` and :code:`Time`
        tuples . The date tuple contains the following parse components: :code:`YYYY`,
        :code:`MM`, :code:`DD`, :code:`Www`, :code:`D`, :code:`DDD`. The time tuple
        contains the following parse components :code:`hh`, :code:`mm`, :code:`ss`,
        :code:`tz`, where :code:`tz` itself is a tuple with the following components
        :code:`negative`, :code:`Z`, :code:`hh`, :code:`mm`, :code:`name` with :code:`negative`
        and :code:`Z` being booleans::  >>> import aniso8601  >>> from aniso8601.builders

        \U0001F607 WhyWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited
        to my expectations, and I wanted to propose areliable alternative using a
        completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!I
        **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different
        tables** canproduce **two identical rendered string.**What I want is to get
        readable text, the best I can. In a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.**
        How cool is that ? \U0001F60EDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer
        or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer
        to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.## \U0001F370 How  - Discard
        all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.  - Measure
        noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.
        \ - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.  - Additionally, we measure
        coherence / probe for a language.**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and
        coherence according to **YOU ?***Noise :* I opened hundred of text files,
        **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then**I
        established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems
        like** a mess. I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably
        incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to improve or rewrite it.*Coherence
        :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance
        occurrences (the best we can). So I thoughtthat intel is worth something here.
        So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent
        design.## \u26A1 Known limitations  - Language detection is unreliable when
        text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english
        tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))  - Every charset detector
        heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run
        detection on very tiny content.## \u26A0\uFE0F About Python EOLs**If you are

        charset name whenever possible.- The detection mechanism has been slightly
        improved, now Turkish content is detected correctly (most of the time)- The
        program has been rewritten to ease the readability and maintainability. (+Using
        static typing)+- utf_7 detection has been reinstated.### Removed- This package

        (2021-05-21)### Removed- Using standard logging instead of using the package
        loguru.- Dropping nose test framework in favor of the maintained pytest.-
        Choose to not use dragonmapper package to help with gibberish Chinese/CJK
        text.- Require cached_property only for Python 3.5 due to constraint. Dropping
        for every other interpreter version.- Stop support for UTF-7 that does not
        contain a SIG.- Dropping PrettyTable, replaced with pure JSON output in CLI.###
        Fixed- BOM marker in a CharsetNormalizerMatch instance could be False in rare
        cases even if obviously present. Due to the sub-match factoring process.-
        Not searching properly for the BOM when trying utf32/16 parent codec.### Changed-
        Improving the package final size by compressing frequencies.json.- Huge improvement
        over the larges payload.### Added- CLI now produces JSON consumable output.-

        errors due to a bad bytes payload (PR #40)## [1.3.8](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.7...1.3.8)
        (2021-05-12)### Fixed- Empty given payload for detection may cause an exception
        if trying to access the `alphabets` property. (PR #39)## [1.3.7](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.6...1.3.7)
        (2021-05-12)### Fixed- The legacy detect function should return UTF-8-SIG
        if sig is present in the payload. (PR #38)## [1.3.6](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.5...1.3.6)
        (2021-02-09)### Changed- Amend the previous release to allow prettytable 2.0

      Description: '# cloudpickle[![Automated Tests](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/workflows/Automated%20Tests/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/actions)[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/cloudpipe/cloudpickle?branch=master)`cloudpickle`
        makes it possible to serialize Python constructs not supportedby the default
        `pickle` module from the Python standard library.`cloudpickle` is especially
        useful for **cluster computing** where Pythoncode is shipped over the network
        to execute on remote hosts, possibly closeto the data.Among other things,
        `cloudpickle` supports pickling for **lambda functions**along with **functions
        and classes defined interactively** in the`__main__` module (for instance
        in a script, a shell or a Jupyter notebook).Cloudpickle can only be used to
        send objects between the **exact same versionof Python**.Using `cloudpickle`
        for **long-term object storage is not supported andstrongly discouraged.****Security
        notice**: one should **only load pickle data from trusted sources** asotherwise
        `pickle.load` can lead to arbitrary code execution resulting in a criticalsecurity
        vulnerability.Installation------------The latest release of `cloudpickle`
        is available from[pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudpickle):    pip
        install cloudpickleExamples--------Pickling a lambda expression:```python>>>
        import cloudpickle>>> squared = lambda x: x ** 2>>> pickled_lambda = cloudpickle.dumps(squared)>>>
        import pickle>>> new_squared = pickle.loads(pickled_lambda)>>> new_squared(2)4```Pickling
        a function interactively defined in a Python shell session(in the `__main__`
        module):```python>>> CONSTANT = 42>>> def my_function(data: int) -> int:...     return
        data + CONSTANT...>>> pickled_function = cloudpickle.dumps(my_function)>>>
        depickled_function = pickle.loads(pickled_function)>>> depickled_function<function
        __main__.my_function(data:int) -> int>>>> depickled_function(43)85```Overriding
        pickle''s serialization mechanism for importable constructs:----------------------------------------------------------------------An
        important difference between `cloudpickle` and `pickle` is that`cloudpickle`
        can serialize a function or class **by value**, whereas `pickle`can only serialize
        it **by reference**. Serialization by reference treatsfunctions and classes
        as attributes of modules, and pickles them throughinstructions that trigger
        the import of their module at load time.Serialization by reference is thus
        limited in that it assumes that the modulecontaining the function or class
        is available/importable in the unpicklingenvironment. This assumption breaks
        when pickling constructs defined in aninteractive session, a case that is
        automatically detected by `cloudpickle`,that pickles such constructs **by
        value**.Another case where the importability assumption is expected to break
        is whendeveloping a module in a distributed execution environment: the workerprocesses
        may not have access to the said module, for example if they live on adifferent
        machine than the process in which the module is being developed. Byitself,
        `cloudpickle` cannot detect such "locally importable" modules andswitch to
        serialization by value; instead, it relies on its default mode, whichis serialization
        by reference. However, since `cloudpickle 2.0.0`, one canexplicitly specify
        modules for which serialization by value should be used,using the`register_pickle_by_value(module)`/`/unregister_pickle_by_value(module)`
        API:```python>>> import cloudpickle>>> import my_module>>> cloudpickle.register_pickle_by_value(my_module)>>>
        cloudpickle.dumps(my_module.my_function)  # my_function is pickled by value>>>
        cloudpickle.unregister_pickle_by_value(my_module)>>> cloudpickle.dumps(my_module.my_function)  #
        my_function is pickled by reference```Using this API, there is no need to
        re-install the new version of the module onall the worker nodes nor to restart
        the workers: restarting the client Pythonprocess with the new source code
        is enough.Note that this feature is still **experimental**, and may fail in
        the followingsituations:- If the body of a function/class pickled by value
        contains an `import` statement:  ```python  >>> def f():  >>> ... from another_module
        import g  >>> ... # calling f in the unpickling environment may fail if another_module  >>>
        ... # is unavailable  >>> ... return g() + 1  ```- If a function pickled by
        reference uses a function pickled by value during its execution.Running the
        tests------------------ With `tox`, to test run the tests for all the supported
        versions of  Python and PyPy:      pip install tox      tox  or alternatively
        for a specific environment:      tox -e py312- With `pytest` to only run the
        tests for your current version of  Python:      pip install -r dev-requirements.txt      PYTHONPATH=''.:tests''
        pytestHistory-------`cloudpickle` was initially developed by [picloud.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721022102/http://blog.picloud.com/2013/11/17/picloud-has-joined-dropbox/)
        and shipped as part ofthe client SDK.A copy of `cloudpickle.py` was included
        as part of PySpark, the Pythoninterface to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
        Davies Liu, JoshRosen, Thom Neale and other Apache Spark developers improved
        it significantly,most notably to add support for PyPy and Python 3.The aim
        of the `cloudpickle` project is to make that work available to a wideraudience
        outside of the Spark ecosystem and to make it easier to improve itfurther
        notably with the help of a dedicated non-regression test suite.'

        \   # or    conda install -c anaconda coloramaDescription-----------ANSI escape
        character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminaltext and
        cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work onWindows, too,
        by wrapping ``stdout``, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (whichwould appear
        as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into theappropriate win32
        calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,Colorama does
        nothing.This has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printingcolored
        terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existingapplications
        or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output onLinux or
        Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling``colorama.just_fix_windows_console()``
        (since v0.4.6) or ``colorama.init()``(all versions, but may have other side-effects
        \u2013 see below).An alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows
        machines, whichprovides the same behaviour for all applications running in
        terminals. Coloramais intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g.,
        maybe your app doesn'thave an installer.)Demo scripts in the source code repository
        print some colored text usingANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's
        built in ANSIhandling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:..

        \   :width: 668    :height: 325    :alt: Same ANSI sequences on Windows, using
        Colorama.These screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support
        ANSI 'dimtext'; it looks the same as 'normal text'.Usage-----Initialisation..............If
        the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work onWindows,
        then run:.. code-block:: python    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console
        \   just_fix_windows_console()If you're on a recent version of Windows 10
        or better, and your stdout/stderrare pointing to a Windows console, then this
        will flip the magic configurationswitch to enable Windows' built-in ANSI support.If
        you're on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing
        toa Windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr``
        in amagic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues theappropriate
        Win32 calls to emulate them.In all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever.
        Basically the idea isthat this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to
        ANSI escape handling.It's safe to call this function multiple times. It's
        safe to call this functionon non-Windows platforms, but it won't do anything.
        It's safe to call thisfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are
        redirected to a file \u2013 itwon't do anything to those streams.Alternatively,
        you can use the older interface with more features (but also morepotential
        footguns):.. code-block:: python    from colorama import init    init()This
        does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for thefollowing
        differences:- It's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up
        with multiple  layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.- Colorama will
        apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,  and if it
        thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and  ``sys.stderr`` in
        a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences  before printing
        them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if  you want to
        write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and  let Colorama
        decide whether they should actually be output. But note that  Colorama's heuristic
        is not particularly clever.- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to
        enable/disable various  functionality \u2013 see below.To stop using Colorama
        before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.This will restore ``stdout``
        and ``stderr`` to their original values, so thatColorama is disabled. To resume
        using Colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it ischeaper than calling ``init()``
        again (but does the same thing).Most users should depend on ``colorama >=
        0.4.6``, and use``just_fix_windows_console``. The old ``init`` interface will
        be supportedindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to
        fix any issueswith it, also for backwards compatibility.Colored Output..............Cross-platform
        printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama'sconstant shorthand
        for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberatelyrudimentary, see below...
        code-block:: python    from colorama import Fore, Back, Style    print(Fore.RED
        + 'some red text')    print(Back.GREEN + 'and with a green background')    print(Style.DIM
        + 'and in dim text')    print(Style.RESET_ALL)    print('back to normal now')...or
        simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:.. code-block::
        python    print('\\033[31m' + 'some red text')    print('\\033[39m') # and
        reset to default color...or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing
        ANSI librariessuch as the venerable `Termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_the
        fabulous `Blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,or the incredible
        `_Rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.If you wish Colorama's Fore, Back
        and Style constants were more capable,then consider using one of the above
        highly capable libraries to generatecolors, etc, and use Colorama just for
        its primary purpose: to convertthose ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:SIMILARLY,
        do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.We are
        only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, notshortcuts
        like the above to generate ANSI characters... code-block:: python    from
        colorama import just_fix_windows_console    from termcolor import colored
        \   # use Colorama to make Termcolor work on Windows too    just_fix_windows_console()
        \   # then use Termcolor for all colored text output    print(colored('Hello,
        World!', 'green', 'on_red'))Available formatting constants are::    Fore:
        BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.    Back: BLACK,
        RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.    Style: DIM, NORMAL,
        BRIGHT, RESET_ALL``Style.RESET_ALL`` resets foreground, background, and brightness.
        Colorama willperform this reset automatically on program exit.These are fairly
        well supported, but not part of the standard::    Fore: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX,
        LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX,
        LIGHTWHITE_EX    Back: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX,
        LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EXCursor Positioning..................ANSI
        codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See ``demos/demo06.py`` foran
        example of how to generate them.Init Keyword Args.................``init()``
        accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.init(autoreset=False):
        \   If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color
        \   changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=True)`` will
        \   automate that:    .. code-block:: python        from colorama import init
        \       init(autoreset=True)        print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')        print('automatically
        back to default color again')init(strip=None):    Pass ``True`` or ``False``
        to override whether ANSI codes should be    stripped from the output. The
        default behaviour is to strip if on Windows    or if output is redirected
        (not a tty).init(convert=None):    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override
        whether to convert ANSI codes in the    output into win32 calls. The default
        behaviour is to convert if on Windows    and output is to a tty (terminal).init(wrap=True):
        \   On Windows, Colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``
        \   with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their
        work.    If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by
        passing    ``init(wrap=False)``. The default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset``
        or    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are True.    When wrapping is disabled, colored
        printing on non-Windows platforms will    continue to work as normal. To do
        cross-platform colored output, you can    use Colorama's ``AnsiToWin32`` proxy
        directly:    .. code-block:: python        import sys        from colorama
        import init, AnsiToWin32        init(wrap=False)        stream = AnsiToWin32(sys.stderr).stream
        \       # Python 2        print >>stream, Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr'
        \       # Python 3        print(Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)Recognised
        ANSI Sequences.........................ANSI sequences generally take the form::
        \   ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>Where ``<param>`` is an integer,
        and ``<command>`` is a single letter. Zero ormore params are passed to a ``<command>``.
        If no params are passed, it isgenerally synonymous with passing a single zero.
        No spaces exist in thesequence; they have been inserted here simply to read
        more easily.The only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls
        are::    ESC [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)    ESC [ 1 m
        \      # bright    ESC [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)

        text on magenta backgroundAll other ANSI sequences of the form ``ESC [ <param>
        ; <param> ... <command>``are silently stripped from the output on Windows.Any
        other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternativeinitial
        characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to addthem though.
        Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues onGitHub.Status
        & Known Problems-----------------------I've personally only tested it on Windows
        XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.Some valid ANSI
        sequences aren't recognised.If you're hacking on the code, see `README-hacking.md`_.
        ESPECIALLY, see theexplanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow
        Colorama to generate newtypes of ANSI codes.See outstanding issues and wish-list:https://github.com/tartley/colorama/issuesIf
        anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,I'd
        love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,and
        would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patchor

      Description: '<img alt="ContourPy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contourpy/contourpy/main/docs/_static/contourpy_logo_horiz.svg"
        height="90">ContourPy is a Python library for calculating contours of 2D quadrilateral
        grids.  It is written in C++11 and wrapped using pybind11.It contains the
        2005 and 2014 algorithms used in Matplotlib as well as a newer algorithm that
        includes more features and is available in both serial and multithreaded versions.  It
        provides an easy way for Python libraries to use contouring algorithms without
        having to include Matplotlib as a dependency.  * **Documentation**: https://contourpy.readthedocs.io  *

      Description: '**This package is in maintenance-only mode.** New code should
        use the`importlib.metadata module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html>`_in
        the Python standard library to find and load entry points.Entry points are
        a way for Python packages to advertise objects with somecommon interface.
        The most common examples are ``console_scripts`` entry points,which define
        shell commands by identifying a Python function to run.*Groups* of entry points,
        such as ``console_scripts``, point to objects withsimilar interfaces. An application
        might use a group to find its plugins, ormultiple groups if it has different
        kinds of plugins.The **entrypoints** module contains functions to find and
        load entry points.You can install it from PyPI with ``pip install entrypoints``.To
        advertise entry points when distributing a package, see`entry_points in the
        Python Packaging User Guide<https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#entry-points>`_.The
        ``pkg_resources`` module distributed with ``setuptools`` provides a way todiscover
        entrypoints as well, but it contains other functionality unrelated toentrypoint
        discovery, and it does a lot of work at import time.  Merely*importing* ``pkg_resources``
        causes it to scan the files of all installedpackages. Thus, in environments
        where a large number of packages are installed,importing ``pkg_resources``
        can be very slow (several seconds).By contrast, ``entrypoints`` is focused
        solely on entrypoint discovery and itis faster. Importing ``entrypoints``
        does not scan anything, and getting agiven entrypoint group performs a more
        focused scan.When there are multiple versions of the same distribution in
        differentdirectories on ``sys.path``, ``entrypoints`` follows the rule that
        the firstone wins.  In most cases, this follows the logic of imports.  Similarly,Entrypoints
        relies on ``pip`` to ensure that only one ``.dist-info`` or``.egg-info`` directory
        exists for each installed package.  There is no reliableway to pick which
        of several `.dist-info` folders accurately relates to theimportable modules.'

      Description: 'Flask=====Flask is a lightweight `WSGI`_ web application framework.
        It is designedto make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to
        scale up tocomplex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around `Werkzeug`_and
        `Jinja`_ and has become one of the most popular Python webapplication frameworks.Flask
        offers suggestions, but doesn''t enforce any dependencies orproject layout.
        It is up to the developer to choose the tools andlibraries they want to use.

      Description: "|CI Build Status| |Coverage Status| |PyPI| |Gitter Chat|What is
        this?~~~~~~~~~~~~~| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written
        in Python. The  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and
        OpenType  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX.
        It  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some  Mac-specific
        formats. The project has an `MIT open-source  licence <LICENSE>`__.| Among
        other things this means you can use it free of charge.`User documentation
        <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and`developer documentation
        <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html>`_are available
        at `Read the Docs <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/>`_.Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~FontTools
        requires `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`__ 3.8or later. We try
        to follow the same schedule of minimum Python version support asNumPy (see
        `NEP 29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`__).The
        package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you caninstall it
        with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__:.. code:: sh    pip install fonttoolsIf
        you would like to contribute to its development, you can clone therepository
        from GitHub, install the package in 'editable' mode andmodify the source code
        in place. We recommend creating a virtualenvironment, using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__
        orPython 3 `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ module...
        code:: sh    # download the source code to 'fonttools' folder    git clone
        https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools.git    cd fonttools    # create new
        virtual environment called e.g. 'fonttools-venv', or anything you like    python
        -m virtualenv fonttools-venv    # source the `activate` shell script to enter
        the environment (Unix-like); to exit, just type `deactivate`    . fonttools-venv/bin/activate
        \   # to activate the virtual environment in Windows `cmd.exe`, do    fonttools-venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
        \   # install in 'editable' mode    pip install -e .Optional Requirements---------------------The
        ``fontTools`` package currently has no (required) external dependenciesbesides
        the modules included in the Python Standard Library.However, a few extra dependencies
        are required by some of its modules, whichare needed to unlock optional features.The
        ``fonttools`` PyPI distribution also supports so-called \"extras\", i.e. aset
        of keywords that describe a group of additional dependencies, which can beused
        when installing via pip, or when specifying a requirement.For example:.. code::
        sh    pip install fonttools[ufo,lxml,woff,unicode]This command will install
        fonttools, as well as the optional dependencies thatare required to unlock
        the extra features named \"ufo\", etc.- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/etree.py``  The
        module exports a ElementTree-like API for reading/writing XML files, and  allows
        to use as the backend either the built-in ``xml.etree`` module or  `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__.
        The latter is preferred whenever present,  as it is generally faster and more
        secure.  *Extra:* ``lxml``- ``Lib/fontTools/ufoLib``  Package for reading
        and writing UFO source files; it requires:  * `fs <https://pypi.org/pypi/fs>`__:
        (aka ``pyfilesystem2``) filesystem    abstraction layer.  * `enum34 <https://pypi.org/pypi/enum34>`__:
        backport for the built-in ``enum``    module (only required on Python < 3.4).
        \ *Extra:* ``ufo``- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/woff2.py``  Module to compress/decompress
        WOFF 2.0 web fonts; it requires:  * `brotli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brotli>`__:
        Python bindings of    the Brotli compression library.  *Extra:* ``woff``-
        ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/sfnt.py``  To better compress WOFF 1.0 web fonts, the
        following module can be used  instead of the built-in ``zlib`` library:  *
        `zopfli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopfli>`__: Python bindings of    the
        Zopfli compression library.  *Extra:* ``woff``- ``Lib/fontTools/unicode.py``
        \ To display the Unicode character names when dumping the ``cmap`` table  with
        ``ttx`` we use the ``unicodedata`` module in the Standard Library.  The\_version
        included in there varies between different Python versions.  To use the latest
        available data, you can install:  * `unicodedata2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodedata2>`__:
        \   ``unicodedata`` backport for Python 3.x updated to the latest Unicode
        \   version 15.0.  *Extra:* ``unicode``- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/interpolatable.py``
        \ Module for finding wrong\_contour/component order between different masters.
        \ It requires one of the following packages in order to solve the so-called
        \ \"minimum weight perfect matching problem in bipartite graphs\", or  the
        Assignment problem:  * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`__: the
        Scientific Library    for Python, which internally uses `NumPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`__
        \   arrays and hence is very fast;  * `munkres <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres>`__:
        a pure-Python    module that implements the Hungarian or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.
        \ To plot the results to a PDF or HTML format, you also need to install:  *
        `pycairo <https://pypi.org/project/pycairo/>`__: Python bindings for the    Cairo
        graphics library. Note that wheels are currently only available for    Windows,
        for other platforms see pycairo's `installation instructions    <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.
        \ *Extra:* ``interpolatable``- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/plot.py``  Module for
        visualizing DesignSpaceDocument and resulting VariationModel.  * `matplotlib
        <https://pypi.org/pypi/matplotlib>`__: 2D plotting library.  *Extra:* ``plot``-
        ``Lib/fontTools/misc/symfont.py``  Advanced module for symbolic font statistics
        analysis; it requires:  * `sympy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy>`__:
        the Python library for    symbolic mathematics.  *Extra:* ``symfont``- ``Lib/fontTools/t1Lib.py``
        \ To get the file creator\_and type of Macintosh PostScript Type 1 fonts  on
        Python 3 you need to install the following module, as the old ``MacOS``  module
        is no longer included in Mac Python:  * `xattr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr>`__:
        Python wrapper for    extended filesystem attributes (macOS platform only).
        \ *Extra:* ``type1``- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/removeOverlaps.py``  Simplify
        TrueType glyphs by merging overlapping contours and components.  * `skia-pathops
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypy/skia-pathops>`__: Python    bindings for the
        Skia library's PathOps module, performing boolean    operations on paths (union,
        intersection, etc.).  *Extra:* ``pathops``- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/cocoaPen.py``
        and ``Lib/fontTools/pens/quartzPen.py``  Pens for drawing glyphs with Cocoa
        ``NSBezierPath`` or ``CGPath`` require:  * `PyObjC <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc>`__:
        the bridge between    Python and the Objective-C runtime (macOS platform only).-
        ``Lib/fontTools/pens/qtPen.py``  Pen for drawing glyphs with Qt's ``QPainterPath``,
        requires:  * `PyQt5 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5>`__: Python bindings
        for    the Qt\_cross platform UI and application toolkit.- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/reportLabPen.py``
        \ Pen to drawing glyphs as PNG images, requires:  * `reportlab <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab>`__:
        Python toolkit    for generating PDFs and graphics.- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/freetypePen.py``
        \ Pen to drawing glyphs with FreeType as raster images, requires:  * `freetype-py
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/freetype-py>`__: Python binding    for the FreeType
        library.    - ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/tables/otBase.py``  Use the Harfbuzz library
        to serialize GPOS/GSUB using ``hb_repack`` method, requires:    * `uharfbuzz
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uharfbuzz>`__: Streamlined Cython    bindings
        for the harfbuzz shaping engine      *Extra:* ``repacker``How to make a new
        release~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1) Update ``NEWS.rst`` with all the changes
        since the last release. Write a   changelog entry for each PR, with one or
        two short sentences summarizing it,   as well as links to the PR and relevant
        issues addressed by the PR. Do not   put a new title, the next command will
        do it for you.2) Use semantic versioning to decide whether the new release
        will be a 'major',   'minor' or 'patch' release. It's usually one of the latter
        two, depending on   whether new backward compatible APIs were added, or simply
        some bugs were fixed.3) Run ``python setup.py release`` command from the tip
        of the ``main`` branch.   By default this bumps the third or 'patch' digit
        only, unless you pass ``--major``   or ``--minor`` to bump respectively the
        first or second digit.   This bumps the package version string, extracts the
        changes since the latest   version from ``NEWS.rst``, and uses that text to
        create an annotated git tag   (or a signed git tag if you pass the ``--sign``
        option and your git and Github   account are configured for `signing commits
        <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`__
        \  using a GPG key).   It also commits an additional version bump which opens
        the main branch for   the subsequent developmental cycle4) Push both the tag
        and commit to the upstream repository, by running the command   ``git push
        --follow-tags``. Note: it may push other local tags as well, be   careful.5)
        Let the CI build the wheel and source distribution packages and verify both
        \  get uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).6) [Optional] Go to fonttools
        `Github Releases <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/releases>`__   page
        and create a new release, copy-pasting the content of the git tag   message.
        This way, the release notes are nicely formatted as markdown, and   users
        watching the repo will get an email notification. One day we shall   automate
        that too.Acknowledgements~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In alphabetical order:aschmitz, Olivier

        skip empty components (base glyph with no contours)  when computing the bounding
        box of composite glyphs. This simply restores the existing  behavior before

        [varLib.iup] Added workaround for a Cython bug in ``iup_delta_optimize`` that
        was  leading to IUP tolerance being incorrectly initialised, resulting in
        sub-optimal deltas  (60126435d, cython/cython#5732).- [varLib] Added new command-line

        [varLib] Use sentinel value 0xFFFF to mark a glyph advance in hmtx/vmtx as
        non  participating, allowing sparse masters to contain glyphs for variation
        purposes other  than {H,V}VAR (#3235).- [varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in
        non-default masters as missing, thus not participating  in CFF2 delta computation,
        similarly to how varLib already treats them for gvar (#3234).- Added varLib.avarPlanner

        \"Volto\") for  converting VOLT OpenType Layout sources to FEA format (#3164).4.40.0
        (released 2023-06-12)----------------------------- Published native binary
        wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions and platform  and architectures
        currently supported that would benefit from this. They will include  precompiled
        Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to compile them
        \ from source. The pure-python wheel and source distribution will continue
        to be  published as always (pip will automatically chose them when no binary
        wheel is  available for the given platform, e.g. pypy). Use ``pip install
        --no-binary=fonttools fonttools``  to expliclity request pip to install from

        file for building native binary wheels (#3121).- [fontBuilder] Added glyphDataFormat=0
        option; raise error when glyphs contain cubic  outlines but glyphDataFormat
        was not explicitly set to 1 (#3113, #3119).- [subset] Prune emptied GDEF.MarkGlyphSetsDef
        and remap indices; ensure GDEF is  subsetted before GSUB and GPOS (#3114,
        #3118).- [xmlReader] Fixed issue whereby DSIG table data was incorrectly parsed

        [COLRv1] Added method to automatically compute ClipBoxes (#3027).- [ttFont]
        Fixed getGlyphID to raise KeyError on missing glyphs instead of returning
        \ None. The regression was introduced in v4.27.0 (#3032).- [sbix] Fixed UnboundLocalError:
        cannot access local variable 'rawdata' (#3031).- [varLib] When building VF,
        do not overwrite a pre-existing ``STAT`` table that was built  with feaLib
        from FEA feature file. Also, added support for building multiple VFs  defined
        in Designspace v5 from ``fonttools varLib`` script (#3024).- [mtiLib] Only
        add ``Debg`` table with lookup names when ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING``  env
        variable is set (#3023).4.39.0 (released 2023-03-06)-----------------------------
        [mtiLib] Optionally add `Debg` debug info for MTI feature builds (#3018).-

        \ properly (#3017).- [OS/2] Guard against ZeroDivisionError when calculating
        xAvgCharWidth in the unlikely  scenario no glyph has non-zero advance (#3015).-
        [subset] Recompute xAvgCharWidth independently of --no-prune-unicode-ranges,
        \ previously the two options were involuntarily bundled together (#3012).-
        [fontBuilder] Add ``debug`` parameter to addOpenTypeFeatures method to add
        source  debugging information to the font in the ``Debg`` private table (#3008).-
        [name] Make NameRecord `__lt__` comparison not fail on Unicode encoding errors
        (#3006).- [featureVars] Fixed bug in ``overlayBox`` (#3003, #3005).- [glyf]
        Added experimental support for cubic bezier curves in TrueType glyf table,
        as  outlined in glyf v1 proposal (#2988):  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-cubicOutlines.md-
        Added new qu2cu module and related qu2cuPen, the reverse of cu2qu for converting
        \ TrueType quadratic splines to cubic bezier curves (#2993).- [glyf] Added
        experimental support for reading and writing Variable Composites/Components
        \ as defined in glyf v1 spec proposal (#2958):  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-varComposites.md.-
        [pens]: Added `addVarComponent` method to pen protocols' base classes, which
        pens can implement  to handle varcomponents (by default they get decomposed)
        (#2958).- [misc.transform] Added DecomposedTransform class which implements
        an affine transformation  with separate translate, rotation, scale, skew,
        and transformation-center components (#2598)- [sbix] Ensure Glyph.referenceGlyphName
        is set; fixes error after dumping and  re-compiling sbix table with 'dupe'
        glyphs (#2984).- [feaLib] Be cleverer when merging chained single substitutions
        into same lookup  when they are specified using the inline notation (#2150,
        #2974).- [instancer] Clamp user-inputted axis ranges to those of fvar (#2959).-
        [otBase/subset] Define ``__getstate__`` for BaseTable so that a copied/pickled
        'lazy'  object gets its own OTTableReader to read from; incidentally fixes
        a bug while  subsetting COLRv1 table containing ClipBoxes on python 3.11 (#2965,
        #2968).- [sbix] Handle glyphs with \"dupe\" graphic type on compile correctly
        (#2963).- [glyf] ``endPointsOfContours`` field should be unsigned! Kudos to
        behdad for  spotting one of the oldest bugs in FT. Probably nobody has ever
        dared to make  glyphs with more than 32767 points... (#2957).- [feaLib] Fixed
        handling of ``ignore`` statements with unmarked glyphs to match  makeotf behavior,
        which assumes the first glyph is marked (#2950).- Reformatted code with ``black``
        and enforce new code style via CI check (#2925).- [feaLib] Sort name table
        entries following OT spec prescribed order in the builder (#2927).- [cu2quPen]
        Add Cu2QuMultiPen that converts multiple outlines at a time in  interpolation
        compatible way; its methods take a list of tuples arguments  that would normally
        be passed to individual segment pens, and at the end it  dispatches the converted
        outlines to each pen (#2912).- [reverseContourPen/ttGlyphPen] Add outputImpliedClosingLine
        option (#2913, #2914,  #2921, #2922, #2995).- [gvar] Avoid expanding all glyphs

        (#1737, #2889).- [woff2] Support encoding/decoding OVERLAP_SIMPLE glyf flags
        (#2576, #2884).- [instancer] Update OS/2 class and post.italicAngle when default
        moved (L4)- Dropped support for Python 3.7 which reached EOL, fontTools requires
        3.8+.- [instancer] Fixed instantiateFeatureVariations logic when a rule range
        becomes  default-applicable (#2737, #2880).- [ttLib] Add main to ttFont and
        ttCollection that just decompile and re-compile the  input font (#2869).-
        [featureVars] Insert 'rvrn' lookup at the beginning of LookupList, to work
        around bug  in Apple implementation of 'rvrn' feature which the spec says
        it should be processed  early whereas on macOS 10.15 it follows lookup order
        (#2140, #2867).- [instancer/mutator] Remove 'DSIG' table if present.- [svgPathPen]
        Don't close path in endPath(), assume open unless closePath() (#2089, #2865).4.38.0
        (released 2022-10-21)----------------------------- [varLib.instancer] Added
        support for L4 instancing, i.e. moving the default value of  an axis while
        keeping it variable. Thanks Behdad! (#2728, #2861).  It's now also possible
        to restrict an axis min/max values beyond the current default  value, e.g.
        a font wght has min=100, def=400, max=900 and you want a partial VF that  only
        varies between 500 and 700, you can now do that.  You can either specify two
        min/max values (wght=500:700), and the new default will be  set to either
        the minimum or maximum, depending on which one is closer to the current  default
        (e.g. 500 in this case). Or you can specify three values (e.g. wght=500:600:700)
        \ to specify the new default value explicitly.- [otlLib/featureVars] Set a
        few Count values so one doesn't need to compile the font  to update them (#2860).-
        [varLib.models] Make extrapolation work for 2-master models as well where
        one master  is at the default location (#2843, #2846).  Add optional extrapolate=False
        to normalizeLocation() (#2847, #2849).- [varLib.cff] Fixed sub-optimal packing
        of CFF2 deltas by no longer rounding them to  integer (#2838).- [scaleUpem]
        Calculate numShorts in VarData after scale; handle CFF hintmasks (#2840).4.37.4
        (released 2022-09-30)----------------------------- [subset] Keep nameIDs used
        by CPAL palette entry labels (#2837).- [varLib] Avoid negative hmtx values
        when creating font from variable CFF2 font (#2827).- [instancer] Don't prune
        stat.ElidedFallbackNameID (#2828).- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/Blocks to
        Unicode 15.0 (#2833).4.37.3 (released 2022-09-20)-----------------------------
        Fix arguments in calls to (glyf) glyph.draw() and drawPoints(), whereby offset
        wasn't  correctly passed down; this fix also exposed a second bug, where lsb
        and tsb were not  set (#2824, #2825, adobe-type-tools/afdko#1560).4.37.2 (released
        2022-09-15)----------------------------- [subset] Keep CPAL table and don't
        attempt to prune unused color indices if OT-SVG  table is present even if
        COLR table was subsetted away; OT-SVG may be referencing the  CPAL table;
        for now we assume that's the case (#2814, #2815).- [varLib.instancer] Downgrade
        GPOS/GSUB version if there are no more FeatureVariations  after instancing
        (#2812).- [subset] Added ``--no-lazy`` to optionally load fonts eagerly (mostly
        to ease  debugging of table lazy loading, no practical effects) (#2807).-
        [varLib] Avoid building empty COLR.DeltaSetIndexMap with only identity mappings
        (#2803).- [feaLib] Allow multiple value record types (by promoting to the
        most general format)  within the same PairPos subtable; e.g. this allows variable
        and non variable kerning  rules to share the same subtable. This also fixes
        a bug whereby some kerning pairs  would become unreachable while shapiong
        because of premature subtable splitting (#2772, #2776).- [feaLib] Speed up
        ``VarScalar`` by caching models for recurring master locations (#2798).- [feaLib]
        Optionally cythonize ``feaLib.lexer``, speeds up parsing FEA a bit (#2799).-
        [designspaceLib] Avoid crash when handling unbounded rule conditions (#2797).-
        [post] Don't crash if ``post`` legacy format 1 is malformed/improperly used
        (#2786)- [gvar] Don't be \"lazy\" (load all glyph variations up front) when
        TTFont.lazy=False (#2771).- [TTFont] Added ``normalizeLocation`` method to
        normalize a location dict from the  font's defined axes space (also known
        as \"user space\") into the normalized (-1..+1)  space. It applies ``avar``
        mapping if the font contains an ``avar`` table (#2789).- [TTVarGlyphSet] Support
        drawing glyph instances from CFF2 variable glyph set (#2784).- [fontBuilder]
        Do not error when building cmap if there are zero code points (#2785).- [varLib.plot]
        Added ability to plot a variation model and set of accompaning master  values
        corresponding to the model's master locations into a pyplot figure (#2767).-
        [Snippets] Added ``statShape.py`` script to draw statistical shape of a glyph
        as an  ellips (requires pycairo) (baecd88).- [TTVarGlyphSet] implement drawPoints
        natively, avoiding going through  SegmentToPointPen (#2778).- [TTVarGlyphSet]
        Fixed bug whereby drawing a composite glyph multiple times, its  components
        would shif; needed an extra copy (#2774).4.37.1 (released 2022-08-24)-----------------------------
        [subset] Fixed regression introduced with v4.37.0 while subsetting the VarStore
        of  ``HVAR`` and ``VVAR`` tables, whereby an ``AttributeError: subset_varidxes``
        was  thrown because an apparently unused import statement (with the side-effect
        of  dynamically binding that ``subset_varidxes`` method to the VarStore class)
        had been  accidentally deleted in an unrelated PR (#2679, #2773).- [pens]
        Added ``cairoPen`` (#2678).- [gvar] Read ``gvar`` more lazily by not parsing
        all of the ``glyf`` table (#2771).- [ttGlyphSet] Make ``drawPoints(pointPen)``
        method work for CFF fonts as well via  adapter pen (#2770).4.37.0 (released
        2022-08-23)----------------------------- [varLib.models] Reverted PR #2717
        which added support for \"narrow tents\" in v4.36.0,  as it introduced a regression
        (#2764, #2765). It will be restored in upcoming release  once we found a solution
        to the bug.- [cff.specializer] Fixed issue in charstring generalizer with
        the ``blend`` operator  (#2750, #1975).- [varLib.models] Added support for
        extrapolation (#2757).- [ttGlyphSet] Ensure the newly added ``_TTVarGlyphSet``
        inherits from ``_TTGlyphSet``  to keep backward compatibility with existing
        API (#2762).- [kern] Allow compiling legacy kern tables with more than 64k
        entries (d21cfdede).- [visitor] Added new visitor API to traverse tree of
        objects and dispatch based  on the attribute type: cf. ``fontTools.misc.visitor``
        and ``fontTools.ttLib.ttVisitor``. Added ``fontTools.ttLib.scaleUpem`` module
        that uses the latter to  change a font's units-per-em and scale all the related
        fields accordingly (#2718,  #2755).4.36.0 (released 2022-08-17)-----------------------------
        [varLib.models] Use a simpler model that generates narrower \"tents\" (regions,
        master  supports) whenever possible: specifically when any two axes that actively
        \"cooperate\"  (have masters at non-zero positions for both axes) have a complete
        set of intermediates.  The simpler algorithm produces fewer overlapping regions
        and behaves better with  respect to rounding at the peak positions than the
        generic solver, always matching  intermediate masters exactly, instead of
        maximally 0.5 units off. This may be useful  when 100% metrics compatibility
        is desired (#2218, #2717).- [feaLib] Remove warning when about ``GDEF`` not
        being built when explicitly not  requested; don't build one unconditonally
        even when not requested (#2744, also works  around #2747).- [ttFont] ``TTFont.getGlyphSet``
        method now supports selecting a location that  represents an instance of a
        variable font (supports both user-scale and normalized  axes coordinates via
        the ``normalized=False`` parameter). Currently this only works  for TrueType-flavored
        variable fonts (#2738).4.35.0 (released 2022-08-15)-----------------------------
        [otData/otConverters] Added support for 'biased' PaintSweepGradient start/end
        angles  to match latest COLRv1 spec (#2743).- [varLib.instancer] Fixed bug
        in ``_instantiateFeatureVariations`` when at the same  time pinning one axis
        and restricting the range of a subsequent axis; the wrong axis  tag was being
        used in the latter step (as the records' axisIdx was updated in the  preceding
        step but looked up using the old axes order in the following step) (#2733,
        \ #2734).- [mtiLib] Pad script tags with space when less than 4 char long
        (#1727).- [merge] Use ``'.'`` instead of ``'#'`` in duplicate glyph names
        (#2742).- [gvar] Added support for lazily loading glyph variations (#2741).-
        [varLib] In ``build_many``, we forgot to pass on ``colr_layer_reuse`` parameter
        to  the ``build`` method (#2730).- [svgPathPen] Add a main that prints SVG
        for input text (6df779fd).- [cffLib.width] Fixed off-by-one in optimized values;
        previous code didn't match the  code block above it (2963fa50).- [varLib.interpolatable]
        Support reading .designspace and .glyphs files (via optional  ``glyphsLib``).-
        Compile some modules with Cython when available and building/installing fonttools
        \ from source: ``varLib.iup`` (35% faster), ``pens.momentsPen`` (makes  ``varLib.interpolatable``
        3x faster).- [feaLib] Allow features to be built for VF without also building
        a GDEF table (e.g.  only build GSUB); warn when GDEF would be needed but isn't
        requested (#2705, 2694).- [otBase] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when uharfbuzz
        < 0.23.0 and 'repack' method is  missing (32aa8eaf). Use new ``uharfbuzz.repack_with_tag``
        when available (since  uharfbuzz>=0.30.0), enables table-specific optimizations
        to be performed during  repacking (#2724).- [statisticsPen] By default report
        all glyphs (4139d891). Avoid division-by-zero  (52b28f90).- [feaLib] Added
        missing required argument to FeatureLibError exception (#2693)- [varLib.merge]
        Fixed error during error reporting (#2689). Fixed undefined  ``NotANone``
        variable (#2714).4.34.4 (released 2022-07-07)-----------------------------
        Fixed typo in varLib/merger.py that causes NameError merging COLR glyphs  containing
        more than 255 layers (#2685).4.34.3 (released 2022-07-07)-----------------------------
        [designspaceLib] Don't make up bad PS names when no STAT data (#2684)4.34.2
        (released 2022-07-06)----------------------------- [varStore/subset] fixed
        KeyError exception to do with NO_VARIATION_INDEX while  subsetting varidxes
        in GPOS/GDEF (a08140d).4.34.1 (released 2022-07-06)-----------------------------
        [instancer] When optimizing HVAR/VVAR VarStore, use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=False
        to avoid  including NO_VARIATION_INDEX in AdvWidthMap, RsbMap, LsbMap mappings,
        which would  push the VarIdx width to maximum (4bytes), which is not desirable.
        This also fixes  a hard crash when attempting to subset a varfont after it
        had been partially instanced  with use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=True.4.34.0 (released
        2022-07-06)----------------------------- [instancer] Set RIBBI bits in head
        and OS/2 table when cutting instances and the  subfamily nameID=2 contains
        strings like 'Italic' or 'Bold' (#2673).- [otTraverse] Addded module containing
        methods for traversing trees of otData tables  (#2660).- [otTables] Made DeltaSetIndexMap
        TTX dump less verbose by omitting no-op entries  (#2660).- [colorLib.builder]
        Added option to disable PaintColrLayers's reuse of layers from  LayerList
        (#2660).- [varLib] Added support for merging multiple master COLRv1 tables
        into a variable  COLR table (#2660, #2328). Base color glyphs of same name
        in different masters must have  identical paint graph structure (incl. number
        of layers, palette indices, number  of color line stops, corresponding paint
        formats at each level of the graph),  but can differ in the variable fields
        (e.g. PaintSolid.Alpha). PaintVar* tables  are produced when this happens
        and a VarStore/DeltaSetIndexMap is added to the  variable COLR table. It is
        possible for non-default masters to be 'sparse', i.e.  omit some of the color
        glyphs present in the default master.- [feaLib] Let the Parser set nameIDs
        1 through 6 that were previously reserved (#2675).- [varLib.varStore] Support
        NO_VARIATION_INDEX in optimizer and instancer.- [feaLib] Show all missing
        glyphs at once at end of parsing (#2665).- [varLib.iup] Rewrite force-set
        conditions and limit DP loopback length (#2651).  For Noto Sans, IUP time
        drops from 23s down to 9s, with only a slight size increase  in the final
        font. This basically turns the algorithm from O(n^3) into O(n).- [featureVars]
        Report about missing glyphs in substitution rules (#2654).- [mutator/instancer]
        Added CLI flag to --no-recalc-timestamp (#2649).- [SVG] Allow individual SVG
        documents in SVG OT table to be compressed on uncompressed,  and remember
        that when roundtripping to/from ttx. The SVG.docList is now a list  of SVGDocument
        namedtuple-like dataclass containing an extra ``compressed`` field,  and no
        longer a bare 3-tuple (#2645).- [designspaceLib] Check for descriptor types
        with hasattr() to allow custom classes  that don't inherit the default descriptors
        (#2634).- [subset] Enable sharing across subtables of extension lookups for
        harfbuzz packing  (#2626). Updated how table packing falls back to fontTools
        from harfbuzz (#2668).- [subset] Updated default feature tags following current
        Harfbuzz (#2637).- [svgLib] Fixed regex for real number to support e.g. 1e-4
        in addition to 1.0e-4.  Support parsing negative rx, ry on arc commands (#2596,
        #2611).- [subset] Fixed subsetting SinglePosFormat2 when ValueFormat=0 (#2603).4.33.3
        (released 2022-04-26)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Fixed
        typo in ``deepcopyExceptFonts`` method, preventing font  references to be
        transferred (#2600). Fixed another typo in the name of ``Range``  dataclass's
        ``__post_init__`` magic method (#2597).4.33.2 (released 2022-04-22)-----------------------------
        [otBase] Make logging less verbose when harfbuzz fails to serialize. Do not
        exit  at the first failure but continue attempting to fix offset overflow
        error using  the pure-python serializer even when the ``USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER``
        option was  explicitly set to ``True``. This is normal with fonts with relatively
        large  tables, at least until hb.repack implements proper table splitting.4.33.1
        (released 2022-04-22)----------------------------- [otlLib] Put back the ``FONTTOOLS_GPOS_COMPACT_MODE``
        environment variable to fix  regression in ufo2ft (and thus fontmake) introduced
        with v4.33.0 (#2592, #2593).  This is deprecated and will be removed one ufo2ft
        gets updated to use the new  config setup.4.33.0 (released 2022-04-21)-----------------------------
        [OS/2 / merge] Automatically recalculate ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` after merging
        \ fonts with ``fontTools.merge`` (#2591, #2538).- [misc/config] Added ``fontTools.misc.configTools``
        module, a generic configuration  system (#2416, #2439).  Added ``fontTools.config``
        module, a fontTools-specific configuration  system using ``configTools`` above.
        \ Attached a ``Config`` object to ``TTFont``.- [otlLib] Replaced environment
        variable for GPOS compression level with an  equivalent option using the new
        config system.- [designspaceLib] Incremented format version to 5.0 (#2436).
        \ Added discrete axes, variable fonts, STAT information, either design- or
        \ user-space location on instances.  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.split``
        module to split a designspace  into sub-spaces that interpolate and that represent
        the variable fonts  listed in the document.  Made instance names optional
        and allow computing them from STAT data instead.  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.statNames``
        module.  Allow instances to have the same location as a previously defined
        STAT label.  Deprecated some attributes:  ``SourceDescriptor``: ``copyLib``,
        ``copyInfo``, ``copyGroups``, ``copyFeatures``.  ``InstanceDescriptor``: ``kerning``,
        ``info``; ``glyphs``: use rules or sparse  sources.  For both, ``location``:
        use the more explicit designLocation.  Note: all are soft deprecations and
        existing code should keep working.  Updated documentation for Python methods
        and the XML format.- [varLib] Added ``build_many`` to build several variable
        fonts from a single  designspace document (#2436).  Added ``fontTools.varLib.stat``
        module to build STAT tables from a designspace  document.- [otBase] Try to
        use the Harfbuzz Repacker for packing GSUB/GPOS tables when  ``uharfbuzz``
        python bindings are available (#2552). Disable it by setting the  \"fontTools.ttLib.tables.otBase:USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER\"
        config option to ``False``.  If the option is set explicitly to ``True`` but
        ``uharfbuzz`` can't be imported  or fails to serialize for any reasons, an
        error will be raised (ImportError or  uharfbuzz errors).- [CFF/T2] Ensure
        that ``pen.closePath()`` gets called for CFF2 charstrings (#2577).  Handle
        implicit CFF2 closePath within ``T2OutlineExtractor`` (#2580).4.32.0 (released
        2022-04-08)----------------------------- [otlLib] Disable GPOS7 optimization
        to work around bug in Apple CoreText.  Always force Chaining GPOS8 for now
        (#2540).- [glifLib] Added ``outputImpliedClosingLine=False`` parameter to
        ``Glyph.draw()``,  to control behaviour of ``PointToSegmentPen`` (6b4e2e7).-
        [varLib.interpolatable] Check for wrong contour starting point (#2571).- [cffLib]
        Remove leftover ``GlobalState`` class and fix calls to ``TopDictIndex()``
        \ (#2569, #2570).- [instancer] Clear ``AxisValueArray`` if it is empty after
        instantiating (#2563).4.31.2 (released 2022-03-22)-----------------------------
        [varLib] fix instantiation of GPOS SinglePos values (#2555).4.31.1 (released
        2022-03-18)----------------------------- [subset] fix subsetting OT-SVG when
        glyph id attribute is on the root ``<svg>``  element (#2553).4.31.0 (released
        2022-03-18)----------------------------- [ttCollection] Fixed 'ResourceWarning:
        unclosed file' warning (#2549).- [varLib.merger] Handle merging SinglePos
        with valueformat=0 (#2550).- [ttFont] Update glyf's glyphOrder when calling
        TTFont.setGlyphOrder() (#2544).- [ttFont] Added ``ensureDecompiled`` method
        to load all tables irrespective  of the ``lazy`` attribute (#2551).- [otBase]
        Added ``iterSubTable`` method to iterate over BaseTable's children of  type
        BaseTable; useful for traversing a tree of otTables (#2551).4.30.0 (released
        2022-03-10)----------------------------- [varLib] Added debug logger showing
        the glyph name for which ``gvar`` is built (#2542).- [varLib.errors] Fixed
        undefined names in ``FoundANone`` and ``UnsupportedFormat``  exceptions (ac4d5611).-
        [otlLib.builder] Added ``windowsNames`` and ``macNames`` (bool) parameters
        to the  ``buildStatTabe`` function, so that one can select whether to only
        add one or both  of the two sets (#2528).- [t1Lib] Added the ability to recreate
        PostScript stream (#2504).- [name] Added ``getFirstDebugName``, ``getBest{Family,SubFamily,Full}Name``
        methods (#2526).4.29.1 (released 2022-02-01)-----------------------------
        [colorLib] Fixed rounding issue with radial gradient's start/end circles inside
        \ one another (#2521).- [freetypePen] Handle rotate/skew transform when auto-computing
        width/height of the  buffer; raise PenError wen missing moveTo (#2517)4.29.0
        (released 2022-01-24)----------------------------- [ufoLib] Fixed illegal
        characters and expanded reserved filenames (#2506).- [COLRv1] Don't emit useless
        PaintColrLayers of lenght=1 in LayerListBuilder (#2513).- [ttx] Removed legacy
        ``waitForKeyPress`` method on Windows (#2509).- [pens] Added FreeTypePen that
        uses ``freetype-py`` and the pen protocol for  rasterizating outline paths
        (#2494).- [unicodedata] Updated the script direction list to Unicode 14.0
        (#2484).  Bumped unicodedata2 dependency to 14.0 (#2499).- [psLib] Fixed type
        of ``fontName`` in ``suckfont`` (#2496).4.28.5 (released 2021-12-19)-----------------------------
        [svgPathPen] Continuation of #2471: make sure all occurrences of ``str()``
        are now  replaced with user-defined ``ntos`` callable.- [merge] Refactored
        code into submodules, plus several bugfixes and improvements:  fixed duplicate-glyph-resolution
        GSUB-lookup generation code; use tolerance in glyph  comparison for empty
        glyph's width; ignore space of default ignorable glyphs;  downgrade duplicates-resolution
        missing-GSUB from assert to warn; added --drop-tables  option (#2473, #2475,
        #2476).4.28.4 (released 2021-12-15)----------------------------- [merge] Merge
        GDEF marksets in Lookups properly (#2474).- [feaLib] Have ``fontTools feaLib``
        script exit with error code when build fails (#2459)- [svgPathPen] Added ``ntos``
        option to customize number formatting (e.g. rounding) (#2471).- [subset] Speed
        up subsetting of large CFF fonts (#2467).- [otTables] Speculatively promote
        lookups to extension to speed up compilation. If the  offset to lookup N is
        too big to fit in a ushort, the offset to lookup N+1 is going to  be too big
        as well, so we promote to extension all lookups from lookup N onwards (#2465).4.28.3
        (released 2021-12-03)----------------------------- [subset] Fixed bug while
        subsetting ``COLR`` table, whereby incomplete layer records  pointing to missing
        glyphs were being retained leading to ``struct.error`` upon  compiling. Make
        it so that ``glyf`` glyph closure, which follows the ``COLR`` glyph  closure,
        does not influence the ``COLR`` table subsetting (#2461, #2462).- [docs] Fully
        document the ``cmap`` and ``glyf`` tables (#2454, #2457).- [colorLib.unbuilder]
        Fixed CLI by deleting no longer existing parameter (180bb1867).4.28.2 (released
        2021-11-22)----------------------------- [otlLib] Remove duplicates when building
        coverage (#2433).- [docs] Add interrogate configuration (#2443).- [docs] Remove
        comment about missing \u201Cstart\u201D optional argument to ``calcChecksum``
        (#2448).- [cu2qu/cli] Adapt to the latest ufoLib2.- [subset] Support subsetting
        SVG table and remove it from the list of  drop by default tables (#534).-
        [subset] add ``--pretty-svg`` option to pretty print SVG table contents (#2452).-
        [merge] Support merging ``CFF`` tables (CID-keyed ``CFF`` is still not supported)
        (#2447).- [merge] Support ``--output-file`` (#2447).- [docs] Split table docs
        into individual pages (#2444).- [feaLib] Forbid empty classes (#2446).- [docs]
        Improve documentation for ``fontTools.ttLib.ttFont`` (#2442).4.28.1 (released
        2021-11-08)----------------------------- [subset] Fixed AttributeError while
        traversing a color glyph's Paint graph when there is no  LayerList, which
        is optional (#2441).4.28.0 (released 2021-11-05)-----------------------------
        Dropped support for EOL Python 3.6, require Python 3.7 (#2417).- [ufoLib/glifLib]
        Make filename-clash checks faster by using a set instead of a list (#2422).-
        [subset] Don't crash if optional ClipList and LayerList are ``None`` (empty)
        (#2424, 2439).- [OT-SVG] Removed support for old deprecated version 1 and
        embedded color palettes,  which were never officially part of the OpenType
        SVG spec. Upon compile, reuse offsets  to SVG documents that are identical
        (#2430).- [feaLib] Added support for Variable Feature File syntax. This is
        experimental and subject  to change until it is finalized in the Adobe FEA
        spec (#2432).- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/ScriptExtensions/Blocks to UnicodeData
        14.0 (#2437).4.27.1 (released 2021-09-23)----------------------------- [otlLib]
        Fixed error when chained contextual lookup builder overflows (#2404, #2411).-
        [bezierTools] Fixed two floating-point bugs: one when computing `t` for a
        point  lying on an almost horizontal/vertical line; another when computing
        the intersection  point between a curve and a line (#2413).4.27.0 (released
        2021-09-14)----------------------------- [ttLib/otTables] Cleaned up virtual
        GID handling: allow virtual GIDs in ``Coverage``  and ``ClassDef`` readers;
        removed unused ``allowVID`` argument from ``TTFont``  constructor, and ``requireReal``
        argument in ``TTFont.getGlyphID`` method.  Make ``TTFont.setGlyphOrder`` clear
        reverse glyphOrder map, and assume ``glyphOrder``  internal attribute is never
        modified outside setGlyphOrder; added ``TTFont.getGlyphNameMany``  and ``getGlyphIDMany``
        (#1536, #1654, #2334, #2398).- [py23] Dropped internal use of ``fontTools.py23``
        module to fix deprecation warnings  in client code that imports from fontTools
        (#2234, #2399, #2400).- [subset] Fix subsetting COLRv1 clip boxes when font
        is loaded lazily (#2408).4.26.2 (released 2021-08-09)-----------------------------
        [otTables] Added missing ``CompositeMode.PLUS`` operator (#2390).4.26.1 (released
        2021-08-03)----------------------------- [transform] Added ``transformVector``
        and ``transformVectors`` methods to the  ``Transform`` class. Similar to ``transformPoint``
        but ignore the translation  part (#2386).4.26.0 (released 2021-08-03)-----------------------------
        [xmlWriter] Default to ``\"\\n\"`` for ``newlinestr`` instead of platform-specific
        \ ``os.linesep`` (#2384).- [otData] Define COLRv1 ClipList and ClipBox (#2379).-
        [removeOverlaps/instancer] Added --ignore-overlap-errors option to work around
        \ Skia PathOps.Simplify bug (#2382, #2363, google/fonts#3365).- NOTE: This
        will be the last version to support Python 3.6. FontTools will require  Python
        3.7 or above from the next release (#2350)4.25.2 (released 2021-07-26)-----------------------------
        [COLRv1] Various changes to sync with the latest CORLv1 draft spec. In particular:
        \ define COLR.VarIndexMap, remove/inline ColorIndex struct, add VarIndexBase
        to ``PaintVar*`` tables (#2372);  add reduced-precicion specialized transform
        Paints;  define Angle as fraction of half circle encoded as F2Dot14;  use
        FWORD (int16) for all Paint center coordinates;  change PaintTransform to
        have an offset to Affine2x3;- [ttLib] when importing XML, only set sfntVersion
        if the font has no reader and is empty (#2376)4.25.1 (released 2021-07-16)-----------------------------
        [ttGlyphPen] Fixed bug in ``TTGlyphPointPen``, whereby open contours (i.e.
        starting  with segmentType \"move\") would throw ``NotImplementedError``.
        They are now treated  as if they are closed, like with the ``TTGlyphPen``
        (#2364, #2366).4.25.0 (released 2021-07-05)----------------------------- [tfmLib]
        Added new library for parsing TeX Font Metric (TFM) files (#2354).- [TupleVariation]
        Make shared tuples order deterministic on python < 3.7 where  Counter (subclass
        of dict) doesn't remember insertion order (#2351, #2353).- [otData] Renamed
        COLRv1 structs to remove 'v1' suffix and match the updated draft  spec: 'LayerV1List'
        -> 'LayerList', 'BaseGlyphV1List' -> 'BaseGlyphList',  'BaseGlyphV1Record'
        -> 'BaseGlyphPaintRecord' (#2346).  Added 8 new ``PaintScale*`` tables: with/without
        centers, uniform vs non-uniform.  Added ``*AroundCenter`` variants to ``PaintRotate``
        and ``PaintSkew``: the default  versions no longer have centerX/Y, but default
        to origin.  ``PaintRotate``, ``PaintSkew`` and ``PaintComposite`` formats
        were re-numbered.  NOTE: these are breaking changes; clients using the experimental
        COLRv1 API will  have to be updated (#2348).- [pointPens] Allow ``GuessSmoothPointPen``
        to accept a tolerance. Fixed call to  ``math.atan2`` with x/y parameters inverted.
        Sync the code with fontPens (#2344).- [post] Fixed parsing ``post`` table
        format 2.0 when it contains extra garbage  at the end of the stringData array
        (#2314).- [subset] drop empty features unless 'size' with FeatureParams table
        (#2324).- [otlLib] Added ``otlLib.optimize`` module; added GPOS compaction
        algorithm.  The compaction can be run on existing fonts with ``fonttools otlLib.optimize``
        \ or using the snippet ``compact_gpos.py``. There's experimental support for
        \ compacting fonts at compilation time using an environment variable, but
        that  might be removed later (#2326).4.24.4 (released 2021-05-25)-----------------------------
        [subset/instancer] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when instantiating a VF that  contains
        GPOS ValueRecords with ``Device`` tables but without the respective  non-Device
        values (e.g. ``XAdvDevice`` without ``XAdvance``). When not  explicitly set,
        the latter are assumed to be 0 (#2323).4.24.3 (released 2021-05-20)-----------------------------
        [otTables] Fixed ``AttributeError`` in methods that split LigatureSubst,  MultipleSubst
        and AlternateSubst subtables when an offset overflow occurs.  The ``Format``
        attribute was removed in v4.22.0 (#2319).4.24.2 (released 2021-05-20)-----------------------------
        [ttGlyphPen] Fixed typing annotation of TTGlyphPen glyphSet parameter (#2315).-
        Fixed two instances of DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence (#2311).4.24.1
        (released 2021-05-20)----------------------------- [subset] Fixed AttributeError
        when SinglePos subtable has None Value (ValueFormat 0)  (#2312, #2313).4.24.0
        (released 2021-05-17)----------------------------- [pens] Add ``ttGlyphPen.TTGlyphPointPen``
        similar to ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2205).4.23.1 (released 2021-05-14)-----------------------------
        [subset] Fix ``KeyError`` after subsetting ``COLR`` table that initially contains
        \ both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset only requested v1 glyphs; we
        were  not pruning the v0 portion of the table (#2308).- [colorLib] Set ``LayerV1List``
        attribute to ``None`` when empty, it's optional  in CORLv1 (#2308).4.23.0
        (released 2021-05-13)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Allow
        to use ``\\\\UNC`` absolute paths on Windows (#2299, #2306).- [varLib.merger]
        Fixed bug where ``VarLibMergeError`` was raised with incorrect  parameters
        (#2300).- [feaLib] Allow substituting a glyph class with ``NULL`` to delete
        multiple glyphs  (#2303).- [glyf] Fixed ``NameError`` exception in ``getPhantomPoints``
        (#2295, #2305).- [removeOverlaps] Retry pathops.simplify after rounding path
        coordinates to integers  if it fails the first time using floats, to work
        around a rare and hard to debug  Skia bug (#2288).- [varLib] Added support
        for building, reading, writing and optimizing 32-bit  ``ItemVariationStore``
        as used in COLRv1 table (#2285).- [otBase/otConverters] Add array readers/writers
        for int types (#2285).- [feaLib] Allow more than one lookahead glyph/class
        in contextual positioning with  \"value at end\" (#2293, #2294).- [COLRv1]
        Default varIdx should be 0xFFFFFFFF (#2297, #2298).- [pens] Make RecordingPointPen
        actually pass on identifiers; replace asserts with  explicit ``PenError``
        exception (#2284).- [mutator] Round lsb for CF2 fonts as well (#2286).4.22.1
        (released 2021-04-26)----------------------------- [feaLib] Skip references
        to named lookups if the lookup block definition  is empty, similarly to makeotf.
        This also fixes an ``AttributeError`` while  generating ``aalt`` feature (#2276,
        #2277).- [subset] Fixed bug with ``--no-hinting`` implementation for Device
        tables (#2272,  #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping Device tables
        if no-hinting was  requested, but some Device tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000)
        are also used to encode  variation indices and need to be retained.- [otBase]
        Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when decompiling ``MVAR``  table
        with ``lazy=True`` (#2273, #2274).- [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified
        ``GlyphCoordinates`` and  ``TupleVariation`` classes, use ``bytearray`` where
        possible, refactored  phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30% speedup
        in total time  of loading master ttfs, building gvar, and saving (#2261, #2266).-
        [subset] Fixed ``AssertionError`` while pruning unused CPAL palettes when
        \ ``0xFFFF`` is present (#2257, #2259).4.22.0 (released 2021-04-01)-----------------------------
        [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst, LigatureSubst,
        \ AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).  ATTENTION: This will change your
        TTX dumps!- [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite
        as a tuple  subclass (#2201).- [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib
        (#2209).- [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error accumulation
        from  multiple deltas (#2214)- [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly
        terms (#2223, #2226)- [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)- [varLib/otlLib]
        Allow merging into VariationFont without first saving GPOS  PairPos2 (#2229)-
        [subset] Improve PairPosFormat2 subsetting (#2221)- [ttLib] TTFont.save: create
        file on disk as late as possible (#2253)- [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators
        LanguageGroup and ExpansionFactor  (#2249)  ATTENTION: This will change your
        TTX dumps!4.21.1 (released 2021-02-26)----------------------------- [pens]
        Reverted breaking change that turned ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen``
        \ into abstract base classes (#2164, #2198).4.21.0 (released 2021-02-26)-----------------------------
        [feaLib] Indent anchor statements in ``asFea()`` to make them more legible
        and  diff-able (#2193).- [pens] Turn ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen``
        into abstract base classes  (#2164).- [feaLib] Added support for parsing and
        building ``STAT`` table from AFDKO feature  files (#2039).- [instancer] Added
        option to update name table of generated instance using ``STAT``  table's
        axis values (#2189).- [bezierTools] Added functions to compute bezier point-at-time,
        as well as line-line,  curve-line and curve-curve intersections (#2192).4.20.0
        (released 2021-02-15)----------------------------- [COLRv1] Added ``unbuildColrV1``
        to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to raw json-able  data structure; it does the
        reverse of ``buildColrV1`` (#2171).- [feaLib] Allow ``sub X by NULL`` sequence
        to delete a glyph (#2170).- [arrayTools] Fixed ``Vector`` division (#2173).-
        [COLRv1] Define new ``PaintSweepGradient`` (#2172).- [otTables] Moved ``Paint.Format``
        enum class outside of ``Paint`` class definition,  now named ``PaintFormat``.
        It was clashing with paint instance ``Format`` attribute  and thus was breaking
        lazy load of COLR table which relies on magic ``__getattr__``  (#2175).- [COLRv1]
        Replace hand-coded builder functions with otData-driven dynamic  implementation
        (#2181).- [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats (#2181).-
        [subset] Added support for subsetting COLR v1 and CPAL tables (#2174, #2177).-
        [fontBuilder] Allow ``setupFvar`` to optionally take ``designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor``
        \ objects. Added new ``setupAvar`` method. Support localised names for axes
        and  named instances (#2185).4.19.1 (released 2021-01-28)-----------------------------
        [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now stays an off-curve
        \ point after compression.4.19.0 (released 2021-01-25)-----------------------------
        [codecs] Handle ``errors`` parameter different from 'strict' for the custom
        \ extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).- [featureVars] Raise better error
        message when a script is missing the required  default language system (#2154).-
        [COLRv1] Avoid abrupt change caused by rounding ``PaintRadialGradient.c0``
        when  the start circle almost touches the end circle's perimeter (#2148).-
        [COLRv1] Support building unlimited lists of paints as 255-ary trees of  ``PaintColrLayers``
        tables (#2153).- [subset] Prune redundant format-12 cmap subtables when all
        non-BMP characters  are dropped (#2146).- [basePen] Raise ``MissingComponentError``
        instead of bare ``KeyError`` when a  referenced component is missing (#2145).4.18.2
        (released 2020-12-16)----------------------------- [COLRv1] Implemented ``PaintTranslate``
        paint format (#2129).- [varLib.cff] Fixed unbound local variable error (#1787).-
        [otlLib] Don't crash when creating OpenType class definitions if some glyphs
        \ occur more than once (#2125).4.18.1 (released 2020-12-09)-----------------------------
        [colorLib] Speed optimization for ``LayerV1ListBuilder`` (#2119).- [mutator]
        Fixed missing tab in ``interpolate_cff2_metrics`` (0957dc7a).4.18.0 (released
        2020-12-04)----------------------------- [COLRv1] Update to latest draft:
        added ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew`` (#2118).- [woff2] Support new ``brotlicffi``
        bindings for PyPy (#2117).- [glifLib] Added ``expectContentsFile`` parameter
        to ``GlyphSet``, for use when  reading existing UFOs, to comply with the specification
        stating that a  ``contents.plist`` file must exist in a glyph set (#2114).-
        [subset] Allow ``LangSys`` tags in ``--layout-scripts`` option (#2112). For
        example:  ``--layout-scripts=arab.dflt,arab.URD,latn``; this will keep ``DefaultLangSys``
        \ and ``URD`` language for ``arab`` script, and all languages for ``latn``
        script.- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow UFOs to be checked; report open paths,
        non existant  glyphs; add a ``--json`` option to produce a machine-readable
        list of  incompatibilities- [pens] Added ``QuartzPen`` to create ``CGPath``
        from glyph outlines on macOS.  Requires pyobjc (#2107).- [feaLib] You can
        export ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING=1`` to enable feature file  debugging
        info stored in ``Debg`` table (#2106).- [otlLib] Build more efficient format
        1 and format 2 contextual lookups whenever  possible (#2101).4.17.1 (released
        2020-11-16)----------------------------- [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0
        when building COLR v0 table; when color  layers are stored in UFO lib plist,
        we can't distinguish tuples from lists so  we need to accept either types
        (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).4.17.0 (released 2020-11-12)-----------------------------
        [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft ``COLR`` v1 spec (#2092).- [svgLib]
        Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not separated  by
        space or comma (#2094).- [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing',
        if the default glyph is  not empty (#2082).- [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup
        location for ``Debg`` if ``Builder.buildLookups_``  has cooperated (#2065,
        #2067).- [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).- [varLib]
        Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).- Add HashPointPen
        adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of a glyph  can be computed,
        which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).4.16.1 (released 2020-10-05)-----------------------------
        [varLib.instancer] Fixed ``TypeError`` exception when instantiating a VF with
        \ a GSUB table 1.1 in which ``FeatureVariations`` attribute is present but
        set to  ``None`` -- indicating that optional ``FeatureVariations`` is missing
        (#2077).- [glifLib] Make ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of the ``point`` element
        required  even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful ``GlifLibError``
        \ message when that happens (#2075).4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)-----------------------------
        [removeOverlaps] Added new module and ``removeOverlaps`` function that merges
        \ overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the
        \ `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.  Note
        that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).- [varLib.instancer]
        Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.  The ``overlap`` option in
        ``instantiateVariableFont`` now takes an ``OverlapMode``  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS,
        1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2: REMOVE.  The latter is equivalent
        to calling ``removeOverlaps`` on the generated static  instance. The option
        continues to accept ``bool`` value for backward compatibility.4.15.0 (released
        2020-09-21)----------------------------- [plistlib] Added typing annotations
        to plistlib module. Set up mypy static  typechecker to run automatically on
        CI (#2061).- [ttLib] Implement private ``Debg`` table, a reverse-DNS namespaced
        JSON dict.- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the ``Debg`` table with
        the original  lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination
        (if any),  and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx
        output for  a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).- [sfnt]
        Disabled checksum checking by default in ``SFNTReader`` (#2058).- [Docs] Document
        ``mtiLib`` module (#2027).- [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour
        node count and operation type  of each node (#2054).- [ttLib] Added API to
        register custom table packer/unpacker classes (#2055).4.14.0 (released 2020-08-19)-----------------------------
        [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).- [Docs]
        Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).- [ttLib] Fixed
        21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation (#2044,  #2045).-
        [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point (81d0042a).-
        [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether the
        \ optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).- [Snippets] Added
        snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF (#2030).- [otlLib] Generate
        GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where appropriate  (#2016).4.13.0
        (released 2020-07-10)----------------------------- [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup
        subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib; refactored  some common code (#2004,
        #2007).- [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).- [glifLib] Fixed bug with
        some UFO .glif filenames clashing on case-insensitive  filesystems (#2001,
        #2002).- [colorLib] Updated COLRv1 implementation following changes in the
        draft spec:  (#2008, googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec#24).4.12.1 (released
        2020-06-16)----------------------------- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed error in ``addMultilingualName``
        with one-character names.  Only attempt to recovered malformed UTF-16 data
        from a ``bytes`` string,  not from unicode ``str`` (#1997, #1998).4.12.0 (released
        2020-06-09)----------------------------- [otlLib/varLib] Ensure that the ``AxisNameID``
        in the ``STAT`` and ``fvar``  tables is grater than 255 as per OpenType spec
        (#1985, #1986).- [docs] Document more modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package:
        ``filenames``,  ``fixedTools``, ``intTools``, ``loggingTools``, ``macCreatorType``,
        ``macRes``,  ``plistlib`` (#1981).- [OS/2] Don't calculate whole sets of unicode
        codepoints, use faster and more memory  efficient ranges and bisect lookups
        (#1984).- [voltLib] Support writing back abstract syntax tree as VOLT data
        (#1983).- [voltLib] Accept DO_NOT_TOUCH_CMAP keyword (#1987).- [subset/merge]
        Fixed a namespace clash involving a private helper class (#1955).4.11.0 (released
        2020-05-28)----------------------------- [feaLib] Introduced ``includeDir``
        parameter on Parser and IncludingLexer to  explicitly specify the directory
        to search when ``include()`` statements are  encountered (#1973).- [ufoLib]
        Silently delete duplicate glyphs within the same kerning group when reading
        \ groups (#1970).- [ttLib] Set version of COLR table when decompiling COLRv1
        (commit 9d8a7e2).4.10.2 (released 2020-05-20)-----------------------------
        [sfnt] Fixed ``NameError: SimpleNamespace`` while reading TTC header. The
        regression  was introduced with 4.10.1 after removing ``py23`` star import.4.10.1
        (released 2020-05-19)----------------------------- [sfnt] Make ``SFNTReader``
        pickleable even when TTFont is loaded with lazy=True  option and thus keeps
        a reference to an external file (#1962, #1967).- [feaLib.ast] Restore backward
        compatibility (broken in 4.10 with #1905) for  ``ChainContextPosStatement``
        and ``ChainContextSubstStatement`` classes.  Make them accept either list
        of lookups or list of lists of lookups (#1961).- [docs] Document some modules
        in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``arrayTools``,  ``bezierTools`` ``cliTools``
        and ``eexec`` (#1956).- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Fixed ``findMultilingualName()``
        when name record's ``string`` is  encoded as bytes sequence (#1963).4.10.0
        (released 2020-05-15)----------------------------- [varLib] Allow feature
        variations to be active across the entire space (#1957).- [ufoLib] Added support
        for ``formatVersionMinor`` in UFO's ``fontinfo.plist`` and for  ``formatMinor``
        attribute in GLIF file as discussed in unified-font-object/ufo-spec#78.  No
        changes in reading or writing UFOs until an upcoming (non-0) minor update
        of the  UFO specification is published (#1786).- [merge] Fixed merging fonts
        with different versions of ``OS/2`` table (#1865, #1952).- [subset] Fixed
        ``AttributeError`` while subsetting ``ContextSubst`` and ``ContextPos``  Format
        3 subtable (#1879, #1944).- [ttLib.table._m_e_t_a] if data happens to be ascii,
        emit comment in TTX (#1938).- [feaLib] Support multiple lookups per glyph

        in initializer (#1932).- [Doc] Improved documentation for the following modules:
        ``afmLib`` (#1933), ``agl``  (#1934), ``cffLib`` (#1935), ``cu2qu`` (#1937),
        ``encodings`` (#1940), ``feaLib``  (#1941), ``merge`` (#1949).- [Doc] Split
        off developer-centric info to new page, making front page of docs more  user-focused.

        [Doc] Added help options to ``fonttools`` command line tool (#1913, #1920).
        \ Ensure all fonttools CLI tools have help documentation (#1948).- [ufoLib]
        Only write fontinfo.plist when there actually is content (#1911).4.9.0 (released
        2020-04-29)---------------------------- [subset] Fixed subsetting of FeatureVariations
        table. The subsetter no longer drops  FeatureVariationRecords that have empty
        substitutions as that will keep the search  going and thus change the logic.
        It will only drop empty records that occur at the  end of the FeatureVariationRecords
        array (#1881).- [subset] Remove FeatureVariations table and downgrade GSUB/GPOS
        to version 0x10000  when FeatureVariations contain no FeatureVariationRecords
        after subsetting (#1903).- [agl] Add support for legacy Adobe Glyph List of
        glyph names in ``fontTools.agl``  (#1895).- [feaLib] Ignore superfluous script
        statements (#1883).- [feaLib] Hide traceback by default on ``fonttools feaLib``
        command line.  Use ``--traceback`` option to show (#1898).- [feaLib] Check
        lookup index in chaining sub/pos lookups and print better error  message (#1896,
        #1897).- [feaLib] Fix building chained alt substitutions (#1902).- [Doc] Included
        all fontTools modules in the sphinx-generated documentation, and  published
        it to ReadTheDocs for continuous documentation of the fontTools project  (#1333).

        [transform] The ``Transform`` class is now subclass of ``typing.NamedTuple``.
        No  change in functionality (#1904).4.8.1 (released 2020-04-17)----------------------------
        [feaLib] Fixed ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' has no attribute 'getAlternateGlyphs'``
        \ when ``aalt`` feature references a chain contextual substitution lookup
        \ (googlefonts/fontmake#648, #1878).4.8.0 (released 2020-04-16)----------------------------
        [feaLib] If Parser is initialized without a ``glyphNames`` parameter, it cannot
        \ distinguish between a glyph name containing an hyphen, or a range of glyph
        names;  instead of raising an error, it now interprets them as literal glyph
        names, while  also outputting a logging warning to alert user about the ambiguity
        (#1768, #1870).- [feaLib] When serializing AST to string, emit spaces around
        hyphens that denote  ranges. Also, fixed an issue with CID ranges when round-tripping
        AST->string->AST  (#1872).- [Snippets/otf2ttf] In otf2ttf.py script update
        LSB in hmtx to match xMin (#1873).- [colorLib] Added experimental support
        for building ``COLR`` v1 tables as per  the `colr-gradients-spec <https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/blob/main/colr-gradients-spec.md>`__
        \ draft proposal. **NOTE**: both the API and the XML dump of ``COLR`` v1 are
        \ susceptible to change while the proposal is being discussed and formalized
        (#1822).4.7.0 (released 2020-04-03)---------------------------- [cu2qu] Added
        ``fontTools.cu2qu`` package, imported from the original  `cu2qu <https://github.com/googlefonts/cu2qu>`__
        project. The ``cu2qu.pens`` module  was moved to ``fontTools.pens.cu2quPen``.
        The optional cu2qu extension module  can be compiled by installing `Cython
        <https://cython.org/>`__ before installing  fonttools from source (i.e. git
        repo or sdist tarball). The wheel package that  is published on PyPI (i.e.
        the one ``pip`` downloads, unless ``--no-binary``  option is used), will continue
        to be pure-Python for now (#1868).4.6.0 (released 2020-03-24)----------------------------
        [varLib] Added support for building variable ``BASE`` table version 1.1 (#1858).-
        [CPAL] Added ``fromRGBA`` method to ``Color`` class (#1861).4.5.0 (released
        2020-03-20)---------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added ``add{Axis,Source,Instance,Rule}Descriptor``
        methods to  ``DesignSpaceDocument`` class, to initialize new descriptor objects
        using keyword  arguments, and at the same time append them to the current
        document (#1860).- [unicodedata] Update to Unicode 13.0 (#1859).4.4.3 (released
        2020-03-13)---------------------------- [varLib] Always build ``gvar`` table
        for TrueType-flavored Variable Fonts,  even if it contains no variation data.
        The table is required according to  the OpenType spec (#1855, #1857).4.4.2
        (released 2020-03-12)---------------------------- [ttx] Annotate ``LookupFlag``
        in XML dump with comment explaining what bits  are set and what they mean
        (#1850).- [feaLib] Added more descriptive message to ``IncludedFeaNotFound``
        error (#1842).4.4.1 (released 2020-02-26)---------------------------- [woff2]
        Skip normalizing ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables if these are missing from  a
        font (e.g. in NotoColorEmoji using ``CBDT/CBLC`` tables).- [timeTools] Use
        non-localized date parsing in ``timestampFromString``, to fix  error when
        non-English ``LC_TIME`` locale is set (#1838, #1839).- [fontBuilder] Make
        sure the CFF table generated by fontBuilder can be used by varLib  without
        having to compile and decompile the table first. This was breaking in  converting
        the CFF table to CFF2 due to some unset attributes (#1836).4.4.0 (released
        2020-02-18)---------------------------- [colorLib] Added ``fontTools.colorLib.builder``
        module, initially with ``buildCOLR``  and ``buildCPAL`` public functions.
        More color font formats will follow (#1827).- [fontBuilder] Added ``setupCOLR``
        and ``setupCPAL`` methods (#1826).- [ttGlyphPen] Quantize ``GlyphComponent.transform``
        floats to ``F2Dot14`` to fix  round-trip issue when computing bounding boxes
        of transformed components (#1830).- [glyf] If a component uses reference points
        (``firstPt`` and ``secondPt``) for  alignment (instead of X and Y offsets),
        compute the effective translation offset  *after* having applied any transform
        (#1831).- [glyf] When all glyphs have zero contours, compile ``glyf`` table
        data as a single  null byte in order to pass validation by OTS and Windows
        (#1829).- [feaLib] Parsing feature code now ensures that referenced glyph
        names are part of  the known glyph set, unless a glyph set was not provided.-
        [varLib] When filling in the default axis value for a missing location of
        a source or  instance, correctly map the value forward.- [varLib] The avar
        table can now contain mapping output values that are greater than  OR EQUAL
        to the preceeding value, as the avar specification allows this.- [varLib]
        The errors of the module are now ordered hierarchically below VarLibError.
        \ See #1821.4.3.0 (released 2020-02-03)---------------------------- [EBLC/CBLC]
        Fixed incorrect padding length calculation for Format 3 IndexSubTable  (#1817,
        #1818).- [varLib] Fixed error when merging OTL tables and TTFonts were loaded
        as ``lazy=True``  (#1808, #1809).- [varLib] Allow to use master fonts containing
        ``CFF2`` table when building VF (#1816).- [ttLib] Make ``recalcBBoxes`` option
        work also with ``CFF2`` table (#1816).- [feaLib] Don't reset ``lookupflag``
        in lookups defined inside feature blocks.  They will now inherit the current
        ``lookupflag`` of the feature. This is what  Adobe ``makeotf`` also does in
        this case (#1815).- [feaLib] Fixed bug with mixed single/multiple substitutions.
        If a single substitution  involved a glyph class, we were incorrectly using
        only the first glyph in the class  (#1814).4.2.5 (released 2020-01-29)----------------------------
        [feaLib] Do not fail on duplicate multiple substitutions, only warn (#1811).-
        [subset] Optimize SinglePos subtables to Format 1 if all ValueRecords are
        the same  (#1802).4.2.4 (released 2020-01-09)----------------------------
        [unicodedata] Update RTL_SCRIPTS for Unicode 11 and 12.4.2.3 (released 2020-01-07)----------------------------
        [otTables] Fixed bug when splitting `MarkBasePos` subtables as offsets overflow.
        \ The mark class values in the split subtable were not being updated, leading
        to  invalid mark-base attachments (#1797, googlefonts/noto-source#145).- [feaLib]
        Only log a warning instead of error when features contain duplicate  substitutions
        (#1767).- [glifLib] Strip XML comments when parsing with lxml (#1784, #1785).4.2.2
        (released 2019-12-12)---------------------------- [subset] Fixed issue with
        subsetting FeatureVariations table when the index  of features changes as
        features get dropped. The feature index need to be  remapped to point to index
        of the remaining features (#1777, #1782).- [fontBuilder] Added `addFeatureVariations`
        method to `FontBuilder` class. This  is a shorthand for calling `featureVars.addFeatureVariations`
        on the builder's  TTFont object (#1781).- [glyf] Fixed the flags bug in glyph.drawPoints()
        like we did for glyph.draw()  (#1771, #1774).4.2.1 (released 2019-12-06)----------------------------
        [glyf] Use the ``flagOnCurve`` bit mask in ``glyph.draw()``, so that we ignore
        \ the ``overlap`` flag that may be set when instantiating variable fonts (#1771).4.2.0
        (released 2019-11-28)---------------------------- [pens] Added the following
        pens:  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPen``: filter pen that rounds coordinates and
        components'    offsets to integer;  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPointPen``: like
        the above, but using PointPen protocol.  * ``filterPen.FilterPointPen``: base
        class for filter point pens;  * ``transformPen.TransformPointPen``: filter
        point pen to apply affine transform;  * ``recordingPen.RecordingPointPen``:
        records and replays point-pen commands.- [ttGlyphPen] Always round float coordinates
        and component offsets to integers  (#1763).- [ufoLib] When converting kerning
        groups from UFO2 to UFO3, avoid confusing  groups with the same name as one
        of the glyphs (#1761, #1762,  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#98).4.1.0 (released
        2019-11-18)---------------------------- [instancer] Implemented restricting
        axis ranges (level 3 partial instancing).  You can now pass ``{axis_tag: (min,
        max)}`` tuples as input to the  ``instantiateVariableFont`` function. Note
        that changing the default axis  position is not supported yet. The command-line
        script also accepts axis ranges  in the form of colon-separated float values,
        e.g. ``wght=400:700`` (#1753, #1537).- [instancer] Never drop STAT ``DesignAxis``
        records, but only prune out-of-range  ``AxisValue`` records.- [otBase/otTables]
        Enforce that VarStore.RegionAxisCount == fvar.axisCount, even  when regions
        list is empty to appease OTS < v8.0 (#1752).- [designspaceLib] Defined new
        ``processing`` attribute for ``<rules>`` element,  with values \"first\" or
        \"last\", plus other editorial changes to DesignSpace  specification. Bumped
        format version to 4.1 (#1750).- [varLib] Improved error message when masters'
        glyph orders do not match (#1758,  #1759).- [featureVars] Allow to specify
        custom feature tag in ``addFeatureVariations``;  allow said feature to already
        exist, in which case we append new lookup indices  to existing features. Implemented
        ``<rules>`` attribute ``processing`` according to  DesignSpace specification
        update in #1750. Depending on this flag, we generate  either an 'rvrn' (always
        processed first) or a 'rclt' feature (follows lookup order,  therefore last)
        (#1747, #1625, #1371).- [ttCollection] Added support for context manager auto-closing
        via ``with`` statement  like with ``TTFont`` (#1751).- [unicodedata] Require
        unicodedata2 >= 12.1.0.- [py2.py3] Removed yet more PY2 vestiges (#1743).-
        [_n_a_m_e] Fixed issue when comparing NameRecords with different string types
        (#1742).- [fixedTools] Changed ``fixedToFloat`` to not do any rounding but
        simply return  ``value / (1 << precisionBits)``. Added ``floatToFixedToStr``
        and  ``strToFixedToFloat`` functions to be used when loading from or dumping
        to XML.  Fixed values (e.g. fvar axes and instance coordinates, avar mappings,
        etc.) are  are now stored as un-rounded decimal floats upon decompiling (#1740,
        #737).- [feaLib] Fixed handling of multiple ``LigatureCaret`` statements for
        the same glyph.  Only the first rule per glyph is used, additional ones are
        ignored (#1733).4.0.2 (released 2019-09-26)---------------------------- [voltLib]
        Added support for ``ALL`` and ``NONE`` in ``PROCESS_MARKS`` (#1732).- [Silf]
        Fixed issue in ``Silf`` table compilation and decompilation regarding str
        vs  bytes in python3 (#1728).- [merge] Handle duplicate glyph names better:
        instead of appending font index to  all glyph names, use similar code like
        we use in ``post`` and ``CFF`` tables (#1729).4.0.1 (released 2019-09-11)----------------------------
        [otTables] Support fixing offset overflows in ``MultipleSubst`` lookup subtables
        \ (#1706).- [subset] Prune empty strikes in ``EBDT`` and ``CBDT`` table data
        (#1698, #1633).- [pens] Fixed issue in ``PointToSegmentPen`` when last point
        of closed contour has  same coordinates as the starting point and was incorrectly
        dropped (#1720).- [Graphite] Fixed ``Sill`` table output to pass OTS (#1705).-
        [name] Added ``removeNames`` method to ``table__n_a_m_e`` class (#1719).-
        [ttLib] Added aliases for renamed entries ``ascender`` and ``descender`` in
        \ ``hhea`` table (#1715).4.0.0 (released 2019-08-22)----------------------------
        NOTE: The v4.x version series only supports Python 3.6 or greater. You can
        keep  using fonttools 3.x if you need support for Python 2.- [py23] Removed
        all the python2-only code since it is no longer reachable, thus  unused; only
        the Python3 symbols were kept, but these are no-op. The module is now  DEPRECATED
        and will removed in the future.- [ttLib] Fixed UnboundLocalError for empty
        loca/glyph tables (#1680). Also, allow  the glyf table to be incomplete when
        dumping to XML (#1681).- [varLib.models] Fixed KeyError while sorting masters
        and there are no on-axis for  a given axis (38a8eb0e).- [cffLib] Make sure
        glyph names are unique (#1699).- [feaLib] Fix feature parser to correctly
        handle octal numbers (#1700).3.44.0 (released 2019-08-02)-----------------------------
        NOTE: This is the last scheduled release to support Python 2.7. The upcoming
        fonttools  v4.x series is going to require Python 3.6 or greater.- [varLib]
        Added new ``varLib.instancer`` module for partially instantiating variable
        \ fonts. This extends (and will eventually replace) ``varLib.mutator`` module,
        as  it allows to create not just full static instances from a variable font,
        but also  \"partial\" or \"less variable\" fonts where some of the axes are
        dropped or  instantiated at a particular value.  Also available from the command-line
        as `fonttools varLib.instancer --help`  (#1537, #1628).- [cffLib] Added support
        for ``FDSelect`` format 4 (#1677).- [subset] Added support for subsetting
        ``sbix`` (Apple bitmap color font) table.- [t1Lib] Fixed issue parsing ``eexec``
        section in Type1 fonts when whitespace  characters are interspersed among
        the trailing zeros (#1676).- [cffLib.specializer] Fixed bug in ``programToCommands``
        with CFF2 charstrings (#1669).3.43.2 (released 2019-07-10)-----------------------------
        [featureVars] Fixed region-merging code on python3 (#1659).- [varLib.cff]
        Fixed merging of sparse PrivateDict items (#1653).3.43.1 (released 2019-06-19)-----------------------------
        [subset] Fixed regression when passing ``--flavor=woff2`` option with an input
        font  that was already compressed as WOFF 1.0 (#1650).3.43.0 (released 2019-06-18)-----------------------------
        [woff2] Added support for compressing/decompressing WOFF2 fonts with non-transformed
        \ ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables, as well as with transformed ``hmtx`` table.
        \ Removed ``Snippets/woff2_compress.py`` and ``Snippets/woff2_decompress.py``
        scripts,  and replaced them with a new console entry point ``fonttools ttLib.woff2``
        \ that provides two sub-commands ``compress`` and ``decompress``.- [varLib.cff]
        Fixed bug when merging CFF2 ``PrivateDicts``. The ``PrivateDict``  data from
        the first region font was incorrecty used for all subsequent fonts.  The bug
        would only affect variable CFF2 fonts with hinting (#1643, #1644).  Also,
        fixed a merging bug when VF masters have no blends or marking glyphs (#1632,
        \ #1642).- [loggingTools] Removed unused backport of ``LastResortLogger``
        class.- [subset] Gracefully handle partial MATH table (#1635).- [featureVars]
        Avoid duplicate references to ``rvrn`` feature record in  ``DefaultLangSys``
        tables when calling ``addFeatureVariations`` on a font that  does not already
        have a ``GSUB`` table (aa8a5bc6).- [varLib] Fixed merging of class-based kerning.
        Before, the process could introduce  rogue kerning values and variations for
        random classes against class zero (everything  not otherwise classed).- [varLib]
        Fixed merging GPOS tables from master fonts with different number of  ``SinglePos``
        subtables (#1621, #1641).- [unicodedata] Updated Blocks, Scripts and ScriptExtensions
        to Unicode 12.1.3.42.0 (released 2019-05-28)-----------------------------
        [OS/2] Fixed sign of ``fsType``: it should be ``uint16``, not ``int16`` (#1619).-
        [subset] Skip out-of-range class values in mark attachment (#1478).- [fontBuilder]
        Add an empty ``DSIG`` table with ``setupDummyDSIG`` method (#1621).- [varLib.merger]
        Fixed bug whereby ``GDEF.GlyphClassDef`` were being dropped  when generating
        instance via ``varLib.mutator`` (#1614).- [varLib] Added command-line options
        ``-v`` and ``-q`` to configure logging (#1613).- [subset] Update font extents
        in head table (#1612).- [subset] Make --retain-gids truncate empty glyphs
        after the last non-empty glyph  (#1611).- [requirements] Updated ``unicodedata2``
        backport for Unicode 12.0.3.41.2 (released 2019-05-13)-----------------------------
        [cffLib] Fixed issue when importing a ``CFF2`` variable font from XML, whereby
        \ the VarStore state was not propagated to PrivateDict (#1598).- [varLib]
        Don't drop ``post`` glyph names when building CFF2 variable font (#1609).3.41.1
        (released 2019-05-13)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added
        ``loadSourceFonts`` method to load source fonts using  custom opener function
        (#1606).- [head] Round font bounding box coordinates to integers to fix compile
        error  if CFF font has float coordinates (#1604, #1605).- [feaLib] Don't write
        ``None`` in ``ast.ValueRecord.asFea()`` (#1599).- [subset] Fixed issue ``AssertionError``
        when using ``--desubroutinize`` option  (#1590, #1594).- [graphite] Fixed
        bug in ``Silf`` table's ``decompile`` method unmasked by  previous typo fix
        (#1597). Decode languange code as UTF-8 in ``Sill`` table's  ``decompile``
        method (#1600).3.41.0 (released 2019-04-29)----------------------------- [varLib/cffLib]
        Added support for building ``CFF2`` variable font from sparse  masters, or
        masters with more than one model (multiple ``VarStore.VarData``).  In ``cffLib.specializer``,
        added support for ``CFF2`` CharStrings with  ``blend`` operators (#1547, #1591).-
        [subset] Fixed subsetting ``HVAR`` and ``VVAR`` with ``--retain-gids`` option,
        \ and when advances mapping is null while sidebearings mappings are non-null
        \ (#1587, #1588).- Added ``otlLib.maxContextCalc`` module to compute ``OS/2.usMaxContext``
        value.  Calculate it automatically when compiling features with feaLib. Added
        option  ``--recalc-max-context`` to ``subset`` module (#1582).- [otBase/otTables]
        Fixed ``AttributeError`` on missing OT table fields after  importing font
        from TTX (#1584).- [graphite] Fixed typo ``Silf`` table's ``decompile`` method
        (#1586).- [otlLib] Better compress ``GPOS`` SinglePos (LookupType 1) subtables
        (#1539).3.40.0 (released 2019-04-08)----------------------------- [subset]
        Fixed error while subsetting ``VVAR`` with ``--retain-gids``  option (#1552).-
        [designspaceLib] Use up-to-date default location in ``findDefault`` method
        \ (#1554).- [voltLib] Allow passing file-like object to Parser.- [arrayTools/glyf]
        ``calcIntBounds`` (used to compute bounding boxes of glyf  table's glyphs)
        now uses ``otRound`` instead of ``round3`` (#1566).- [svgLib] Added support
        for converting more SVG shapes to path ``d`` strings  (ellipse, line, polyline),
        as well as support for ``transform`` attributes.  Only ``matrix`` transformations

        on invalid escape sequences (#1562).3.39.0 (released 2019-03-19)-----------------------------
        [ttLib/glyf] Raise more specific error when encountering recursive  component
        references (#1545, #1546).- [Doc/designspaceLib] Defined new ``public.skipExportGlyphs``
        lib key (#1534,  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#84).- [varLib] Use ``vmtx``
        to compute vertical phantom points; or ``hhea.ascent``  and ``head.unitsPerEM``
        if ``vmtx`` is missing (#1528).- [gvar/cvar] Sort XML element's min/value/max
        attributes in TupleVariation  toXML to improve readability of TTX dump (#1527).-
        [varLib.plot] Added support for 2D plots with only 1 variation axis (#1522).-
        [designspaceLib] Use axes maps when normalizing locations in  DesignSpaceDocument
        (#1226, #1521), and when finding default source (#1535).- [mutator] Set ``OVERLAP_SIMPLE``

        Added ``--no-overlap`` cli option  to disable this (#1518).- [subset] Fixed
        subsetting ``VVAR`` table (#1516, #1517).  Fixed subsetting an ``HVAR`` table
        that has an ``AdvanceWidthMap`` when the  option ``--retain-gids`` is used.-
        [feaLib] Added ``forceChained`` in MultipleSubstStatement (#1511).  Fixed
        double indentation of ``subtable`` statement (#1512).  Added support for ``subtable``
        statement in more places than just PairPos  lookups (#1520).  Handle lookupflag
        0 and lookupflag without a value (#1540).- [varLib] In ``load_designspace``,
        provide a default English name for the  ``ital`` axis tag.- Remove pyftinspect
        because it is unmaintained and bitrotted.3.38.0 (released 2019-02-18)-----------------------------

        Jupyter notebook.3.37.3 (released 2019-02-05)-----------------------------
        The previous release accidentally changed several files from Unix to DOS  line-endings.
        Fix that.3.37.2 (released 2019-02-05)----------------------------- [varLib]
        Temporarily revert the fix to ``load_masters()``, which caused a  crash in
        ``interpolate_layout()`` when ``deepcopy``-ing OTFs.3.37.1 (released 2019-02-05)-----------------------------
        [varLib] ``load_masters()`` now actually assigns the fonts it loads to the
        \ source.font attributes.- [varLib] Fixed an MVAR table generation crash when
        sparse masters were  involved.- [voltLib] ``parse_coverage_()`` returns a
        tuple instead of an ast.Enum.- [feaLib] A MarkClassDefinition inside a block
        is no longer doubly indented  compared to the rest of the block.3.37.0 (released
        2019-01-28)----------------------------- [svgLib] Added support for converting
        elliptical arcs to cubic bezier curves  (#1464).- [py23] Added backport for
        ``math.isfinite``.- [varLib] Apply HIDDEN flag to fvar axis if designspace
        axis has attribute  ``hidden=1``.- Fixed \"DeprecationWarning: invalid escape
        sequence\" in Python 3.7.- [voltLib] Fixed parsing glyph groups. Distinguish
        different PROCESS_MARKS.  Accept COMPONENT glyph type.- [feaLib] Distinguish
        missing value and explicit ``<NULL>`` for PairPos2  format A (#1459). Round-trip
        ``useExtension`` keyword. Implemented  ``ValueRecord.asFea`` method.- [subset]
        Insert empty widths into hdmx when retaining gids (#1458).3.36.0 (released
        2019-01-17)----------------------------- [ttx] Added ``--no-recalc-timestamp``
        option to keep the original font's  ``head.modified`` timestamp (#1455, #46).-
        [ttx/psCharStrings] Fixed issues while dumping and round-tripping CFF2 table
        \ with ttx (#1451, #1452, #1456).- [voltLib] Fixed check for duplicate anchors
        (#1450). Don't try to read past  the ``END`` operator in .vtp file (#1453).-
        [varLib] Use sentinel value -0x8000 (-32768) to ignore post.underlineThickness
        \ and post.underlinePosition when generating MVAR deltas (#1449,  googlei18n/ufo2ft#308).-
        [subset] Added ``--retain-gids`` option to subset font without modifying the
        \ current glyph indices (#1443, #1447).- [ufoLib] Replace deprecated calls
        to ``getbytes`` and ``setbytes`` with new  equivalent ``readbytes`` and ``writebytes``
        calls. ``fs`` >= 2.2 no required.- [varLib] Allow loading masters from TTX
        files as well (#1441).3.35.2 (released 2019-01-14)-----------------------------
        [hmtx/vmtx]: Allow to compile/decompile ``hmtx`` and ``vmtx`` tables even

        \ ``vhea`` (#1439).- [varLib] Added support for localized axes' ``labelname``
        and named instances'  ``stylename`` (#1438).3.35.1 (released 2019-01-09)-----------------------------
        [_m_a_x_p] Include ``maxComponentElements`` in ``maxp`` table's recalculation.3.35.0
        (released 2019-01-07)----------------------------- [psCharStrings] In ``encodeFloat``
        function, use float's \"general format\" with  8 digits of precision (i.e.
        ``%8g``) instead of ``str()``. This works around  a macOS rendering issue
        when real numbers in CFF table are too long, and  also makes sure that floats
        are encoded with the same precision in python 2.7  and 3.x (#1430, googlei18n/ufo2ft#306).-
        [_n_a_m_e/fontBuilder] Make ``_n_a_m_e_table.addMultilingualName`` also add
        \ Macintosh (platformID=1) names by default. Added options to ``FontBuilder``
        \ ``setupNameTable`` method to optionally disable Macintosh or Windows names.
        \ (#1359, #1431).- [varLib] Make ``build`` optionally accept a ``DesignSpaceDocument``
        object,  instead of a designspace file path. The caller can now set the ``font``
        \ attribute of designspace's sources to a TTFont object, thus allowing to
        \ skip filenames manipulation altogether (#1416, #1425).- [sfnt] Allow SFNTReader
        objects to be deep-copied.- Require typing>=3.6.4 on py27 to fix issue with
        singledispatch (#1423).- [designspaceLib/t1Lib/macRes] Fixed some cases where
        pathlib.Path objects were  not accepted (#1421).- [varLib] Fixed merging of
        multiple PairPosFormat2 subtables (#1411).- [varLib] The default STAT table
        version is now set to 1.1, to improve  compatibility with legacy applications

        Fixed AssertionError when none of the script tables in GPOS/GSUB have  a DefaultLangSys
        record (#1408, 135a4a1).3.34.1 (released 2018-12-17)-----------------------------
        [varLib] Work around macOS rendering issue for composites without gvar entry
        (#1381).3.34.0 (released 2018-12-14)----------------------------- [varLib]
        Support generation of CFF2 variable fonts. ``model.reorderMasters()``  now
        supports arbitrary mapping. Fix handling of overlapping ranges for feature
        \ variations (#1400).- [cffLib, subset] Code clean-up and fixing related to
        CFF2 support.- [ttLib.tables.ttProgram] Use raw strings for regex patterns
        (#1389).- [fontbuilder] Initial support for building CFF2 fonts. Set CFF's
        \ ``FontMatrix`` automatically from unitsPerEm.- [plistLib] Accept the more
        general ``collections.Mapping`` instead of the  specific ``dict`` class to
        support custom data classes that should serialize  to dictionaries.3.33.0
        (released 2018-11-30)----------------------------- [subset] subsetter bug
        fix with variable fonts.- [varLib.featureVar] Improve FeatureVariations generation
        with many rules.- [varLib] Enable sparse masters when building variable fonts:
        \ https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/pull/1368#issuecomment-437257368-
        [varLib.mutator] Add IDEF for GETVARIATION opcode, for handling hints in an
        \ instance.- [ttLib] Ignore the length of kern table subtable format 03.32.0
        (released 2018-11-01)----------------------------- [ufoLib] Make ``UFOWriter``
        a subclass of ``UFOReader``, and use mixins  for shared methods (#1344).-
        [featureVars] Fixed normalization error when a condition's minimum/maximum
        \ attributes are missing in designspace ``<rule>`` (#1366).- [setup.py] Added
        ``[plot]`` to extras, to optionally install ``matplotlib``,  needed to use
        the ``fonTools.varLib.plot`` module.- [varLib] Take total bounding box into
        account when resolving model (7ee81c8).  If multiple axes have the same range
        ratio, cut across both (62003f4).- [subset] Don't error if ``STAT`` has no
        ``AxisValue`` tables.- [fontBuilder] Added a new submodule which contains
        a ``FontBuilder`` wrapper  class around ``TTFont`` that makes it easier to
        create a working TTF or OTF  font from scratch with code. NOTE: the API is
        still experimental and may  change in future versions.3.31.0 (released 2018-10-21)-----------------------------
        [ufoLib] Merged the `ufoLib <https://github.com/unified-font-objects/ufoLib>`__
        \ master branch into a new ``fontTools.ufoLib`` package (#1335, #1095).  Moved
        ``ufoLib.pointPen`` module to ``fontTools.pens.pointPen``.  Moved ``ufoLib.etree``
        module to ``fontTools.misc.etree``.  Moved ``ufoLib.plistlib`` module to ``fontTools.misc.plistlib``.
        \ To use the new ``fontTools.ufoLib`` module you need to install fonttools
        \ with the ``[ufo]`` extra, or you can manually install the required additional
        \ dependencies (cf. README.rst).- [morx] Support AAT action type to insert
        glyphs and clean up compilation  of AAT action tables (4a1871f, 2011ccf).-
        [subset] The ``--no-hinting`` on a CFF font now also drops the optional  hinting
        keys in Private dict: ``ForceBold``, ``LanguageGroup``, and  ``ExpansionFactor``
        (#1322).- [subset] Include nameIDs referenced by STAT table (#1327).- [loggingTools]
        Added ``msg=None`` argument to  ``CapturingLogHandler.assertRegex`` (0245f2c).-

        2018-09-18)----------------------------- [feaLib] Skip building noop class
        PairPos subtables when Coverage is NULL  (#1318).- [ttx] Expose the previously
        reserved bit flag ``OVERLAP_SIMPLE`` of  glyf table's contour points in the
        TTX dump. This is used in some  implementations to specify a non-zero fill
        with overlapping contours (#1316).- [ttLib] Added support for decompiling/compiling
        ``TS1C`` tables containing  VTT sources for ``cvar`` variation table (#1310).-
        [varLib] Use ``fontTools.designspaceLib`` to read DesignSpaceDocument. The
        \ ``fontTools.varLib.designspace`` module is now deprecated and will be removed
        \ in future versions. The presence of an explicit ``axes`` element is now
        \ required in order to build a variable font (#1224, #1313).- [varLib] Implemented
        building GSUB FeatureVariations table from the ``rules``  element of DesignSpace
        document (#1240, #713, #1314).- [subset] Added ``--no-layout-closure`` option
        to not expand the subset with  the glyphs produced by OpenType layout features.
        Instead, OpenType features  will be subset to only rules that are relevant
        to the otherwise-specified  glyph set (#43, #1121).3.29.1 (released 2018-09-10)-----------------------------
        [feaLib] Fixed issue whereby lookups from DFLT/dflt were not included in the
        \ DFLT/non-dflt language systems (#1307).- [graphite] Fixed issue on big-endian
        architectures (e.g. ppc64) (#1311).- [subset] Added ``--layout-scripts`` option
        to add/exclude set of OpenType  layout scripts that will be preserved. By
        default all scripts are retained  (``'*'``) (#1303).3.29.0 (released 2018-07-26)-----------------------------
        [feaLib] In the OTL table builder, when the ``name`` table is excluded  from
        the list of tables to be build, skip compiling ``featureNames`` blocks,  as
        the records referenced in ``FeatureParams`` table don't exist (68951b7).-
        [otBase] Try ``ExtensionLookup`` if other offset-overflow methods fail  (05f95f0).-
        [feaLib] Added support for explicit ``subtable;`` break statements in  PairPos
        lookups; previously these were ignored (#1279, #1300, #1302).- [cffLib.specializer]
        Make sure the stack depth does not exceed maxstack - 1,  so that a subroutinizer
        can insert subroutine calls (#1301,  https://github.com/googlei18n/ufo2ft/issues/266).-
        [otTables] Added support for fixing offset overflow errors occurring inside
        \ ``MarkBasePos`` subtables (#1297).- [subset] Write the default output file
        extension based on ``--flavor`` option,  or the value of ``TTFont.sfntVersion``
        (d7ac0ad).- [unicodedata] Updated Blocks, Scripts and ScriptExtensions for
        Unicode 11  (452c85e).- [xmlWriter] Added context manager to XMLWriter class
        to autoclose file  descriptor on exit (#1290).- [psCharStrings] Optimize the
        charstring's bytecode by encoding as integers  all float values that have
        no decimal portion (8d7774a).- [ttFont] Fixed missing import of ``TTLibError``
        exception (#1285).- [feaLib] Allow any languages other than ``dflt`` under
        ``DFLT`` script  (#1278, #1292).3.28.0 (released 2018-06-19)-----------------------------
        [featureVars] Added experimental module to build ``FeatureVariations``  tables.
        Still needs to be hooked up to ``varLib.build`` (#1240).- [fixedTools] Added
        ``otRound`` to round floats to nearest integer towards  positive Infinity.
        This is now used where we deal with visual data like X/Y  coordinates, advance
        widths/heights, variation deltas, and similar (#1274,  #1248).- [subset] Improved
        GSUB closure memoize algorithm.- [varLib.models] Fixed regression in model
        resolution (180124, #1269).- [feaLib.ast] Fixed error when converting ``SubtableStatement``
        to string  (#1275).- [varLib.mutator] Set ``OS/2.usWeightClass`` and ``usWidthClass``,
        and  ``post.italicAngle`` based on the 'wght', 'wdth' and 'slnt' axis values
        \ (#1276, #1264).- [py23/loggingTools] Don't automatically set ``logging.lastResort``
        handler  on py27. Moved ``LastResortLogger`` to the ``loggingTools`` module
        (#1277).3.27.1 (released 2018-06-11)----------------------------- [ttGlyphPen]
        Issue a warning and skip building non-existing components  (https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/411).-
        [tests] Fixed issue running ttx_test.py from a tagged commit.3.27.0 (released
        2018-06-11)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added new ``conditionSet``
        element to ``rule`` element in  designspace document. Bumped ``format`` attribute
        to ``4.0`` (previously,  it was formatted as an integer). Removed ``checkDefault``,
        ``checkAxes``  methods, and any kind of guessing about the axes when the ``<axes>``
        element  is missing. The default master is expected at the intersection of
        all default  values for each axis (#1254, #1255, #1267).- [cffLib] Fixed issues
        when compiling CFF2 or converting from CFF when the  font has an FDArray (#1211,
        #1271).- [varLib] Avoid attempting to build ``cvar`` table when ``glyf`` table
        is not  present, as is the case for CFF2 fonts.- [subset] Handle None coverages
        in MarkGlyphSets; revert commit 02616ab that  sets empty Coverage tables in
        MarkGlyphSets to None, to make OTS happy.- [ttFont] Allow to build glyph order
        from ``maxp.numGlyphs`` when ``post`` or  ``cmap`` are missing.- [ttFont]
        Added ``__len__`` method to ``_TTGlyphSet``.- [glyf] Ensure ``GlyphCoordinates``
        never overflow signed shorts (#1230).- [py23] Added alias for ``itertools.izip``
        shadowing the built-in ``zip``.- [loggingTools] Memoize ``log`` property of
        ``LogMixin`` class (fbab12).- [ttx] Impoved test coverage (#1261).- [Snippets]
        Addded script to append a suffix to all family names in a font.- [varLib.plot]
        Make it work with matplotlib >= 2.1 (b38e2b).3.26.0 (released 2018-05-03)-----------------------------
        [designspace] Added a new optional ``layer`` attribute to the source element,
        \ and a corresponding ``layerName`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``
        \ object (#1253).  Added ``conditionset`` element to the ``rule`` element
        to the spec, but not  implemented in designspace reader/writer yet (#1254).-
        [varLib.models] Refine modeling one last time (0ecf5c5).- [otBase] Fixed sharing
        of tables referred to by different offset sizes  (795f2f9).- [subset] Don't
        drop a GDEF that only has VarStore (fc819d6). Set to None  empty Coverage
        tables in MarkGlyphSets (02616ab).- [varLib]: Added ``--master-finder`` command-line
        option (#1249).- [varLib.mutator] Prune fvar nameIDs from instance's name
        table (#1245).- [otTables] Allow decompiling bad ClassDef tables with invalid
        format, with  warning (#1236).- [varLib] Make STAT v1.2 and reuse nameIDs
        from fvar table (#1242).- [varLib.plot] Show master locations. Set axis limits
        to -1, +1.- [subset] Handle HVAR direct mapping. Passthrough 'cvar'.  Added
        ``--font-number`` command-line option for collections.- [t1Lib] Allow a text
        encoding to be specified when parsing a Type 1 font  (#1234). Added ``kind``
        argument to T1Font constructor (c5c161c).- [ttLib] Added context manager API
        to ``TTFont`` class, so it can be used in  ``with`` statements to auto-close
        the file when exiting the context (#1232).3.25.0 (released 2018-04-03)-----------------------------
        [varLib] Improved support-resolution algorithm. Previously, the on-axis  masters
        would always cut the space. They don't anymore. That's more  consistent, and
        fixes the main issue Erik showed at TYPO Labs 2017.  Any varfont built that
        had an unusual master configuration will change  when rebuilt (42bef17, a523a697,
        \ https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/264).- [varLib.models] Added
        a ``main()`` entry point, that takes positions and  prints model results.-
        [varLib.plot] Added new module to plot a designspace's  VariationModel. Requires
        ``matplotlib``.- [varLib.mutator] Added -o option to specify output file path
        (2ef60fa).- [otTables] Fixed IndexError while pruning of HVAR pre-write (6b6c34a).-
        [varLib.models] Convert delta array to floats if values overflows signed  short
        integer (0055f94).3.24.2 (released 2018-03-26)-----------------------------
        [otBase] Don't fail during ``ValueRecord`` copy if src has more items.  We
        drop hinting in the subsetter by simply changing ValueFormat, without  cleaning
        up the actual ValueRecords. This was causing assertion error if  a variable
        font was subsetted without hinting and then passed directly to  the mutator
        for instantiation without first it saving to disk.3.24.1 (released 2018-03-06)-----------------------------
        [varLib] Don't remap the same ``DeviceTable`` twice in VarStore optimizer
        \ (#1206).- [varLib] Add ``--disable-iup`` option to ``fonttools varLib``
        script,  and a ``optimize=True`` keyword argument to ``varLib.build`` function,
        \ to optionally disable IUP optimization while building varfonts.- [ttCollection]
        Fixed issue while decompiling ttc with python3 (#1207).3.24.0 (released 2018-03-01)-----------------------------
        [ttGlyphPen] Decompose composite glyphs if any components' transform is too
        \ large to fit a ``F2Dot14`` value, or clamp transform values that are  (almost)
        equal to +2.0 to make them fit and avoid decomposing (#1200,  #1204, #1205).-
        [ttx] Added new ``-g`` option to dump glyphs from the ``glyf`` table  splitted
        as individual ttx files (#153, #1035, #1132, #1202).- Copied ``ufoLib.filenames``
        module to ``fontTools.misc.filenames``, used  for the ttx split-glyphs option
        (#1202).- [feaLib] Added support for ``cvParameters`` blocks in Character
        Variant  feautures ``cv01-cv99`` (#860, #1169).- [Snippets] Added ``checksum.py``
        script to generate/check SHA1 hash of  ttx files (#1197).- [varLib.mutator]
        Fixed issue while instantiating some variable fonts  whereby the horizontal
        advance width computed from ``gvar`` phantom points  could turn up to be negative
        (#1198).- [varLib/subset] Fixed issue with subsetting GPOS variation data
        not  picking up ``ValueRecord`` ``Device`` objects (54fd71f).- [feaLib/voltLib]
        In all AST elements, the ``location`` is no longer a  required positional
        argument, but an optional kewyord argument (defaults  to ``None``). This will
        make it easier to construct feature AST from  code (#1201).3.23.0 (released
        2018-02-26)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added an optional
        ``lib`` element to the designspace as a  whole, as well as to the instance
        elements, to store arbitrary data in a  property list dictionary, similar
        to the UFO's ``lib``. Added an optional  ``font`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``,
        to allow operating on  in-memory font objects (#1175).- [cffLib] Fixed issue
        with lazy-loading of attributes when attempting to  set the CFF TopDict.Encoding
        (#1177, #1187).- [ttx] Fixed regression introduced in 3.22.0 that affected
        the split tables  ``-s`` option (#1188).- [feaLib] Added ``IncludedFeaNotFound``
        custom exception subclass, raised  when an included feature file cannot be
        found (#1186).- [otTables] Changed ``VarIdxMap`` to use glyph names internally
        instead of  glyph indexes. The old ttx dumps of HVAR/VVAR tables that contain
        indexes  can still be imported (21cbab8, 38a0ffb).- [varLib] Implemented VarStore
        optimizer (#1184).- [subset] Implemented pruning of GDEF VarStore, HVAR and
        MVAR (#1179).- [sfnt] Restore backward compatiblity with ``numFonts`` attribute
        of  ``SFNTReader`` object (#1181).- [merge] Initial support for merging ``LangSysRecords``
        (#1180).- [ttCollection] don't seek(0) when writing to possibly unseekable
        strems.- [subset] Keep all ``--name-IDs`` from 0 to 6 by default (#1170, #605,
        #114).- [cffLib] Added ``width`` module to calculate optimal CFF default and
        \ nominal glyph widths.- [varLib] Don\u2019t fail if STAT already in the master
        fonts (#1166).3.22.0 (released 2018-02-04)----------------------------- [subset]
        Support subsetting ``endchar`` acting as ``seac``-like components  in ``CFF``
        (fixes #1162).- [feaLib] Allow to build from pre-parsed ``ast.FeatureFile``

        \ returning inconsistent short vs long names. They both return the short four-
        \ letter script codes now. Added ``script_name`` and ``script_code`` functions
        \ to look up the long human-readable script name from the script code, and
        \ viceversa (#1109, #1111).3.20.0 (released 2017-11-21)-----------------------------
        [unicodedata] Addded new module ``fontTools.unicodedata`` which exports the
        \ same interface as the built-in ``unicodedata`` module, with the addition
        of  a few functions that are missing from the latter, such as ``script``,
        \ ``script_extension`` and ``block``. Added a ``MetaTools/buildUCD.py`` script

        #1030 for more details.  NOTE: this change invalidates all the TTX files containing
        CFF2 tables  that where dumped with previous verisons of fonttools.  CFF2
        Subr items can have values on the stack after the last operator, thus  a ``CFF2Subr``
        class was added to accommodate this (#1091).- [_k_e_r_n] Fixed compilation
        of AAT kern version=1.0 tables (#1089, #1094)- [ttLib] Added getBestCmap()

        array when compiling   XML. (#797)-  [varLib] Re-enabled generation of ``HVAR``
        table for fonts with   TrueType outlines; removed ``--build-HVAR`` command-line
        option.-  [feaLib] The parser can now be extended to support non-standard
        \  statements in FEA code by using a customized Abstract Syntax Tree.   See,
        for example, ``feaLib.builder_test.test_extensions`` and   baseClass.feax
        (#794, fixes #773).-  [feaLib] Added ``feaLib`` command to the 'fonttools'
        command-line   tool; applies a feature file to a font. ``fonttools feaLib
        -h`` for   help.-  [pens] The ``T2CharStringPen`` now takes an optional   ``roundTolerance``
        argument to control the rounding of coordinates   (#804, fixes #769).-  [ci]
        Measure test coverage on all supported python versions and OSes,   combine
        coverage data and upload to   https://codecov.io/gh/fonttools/fonttools (#786)-
        \ [ci] Configured Travis and Appveyor for running tests on Python 3.6   (#785,
        55c03bc)-  The manual pages installation directory can be customized through
        \  ``FONTTOOLS_MANPATH`` environment variable (#799, fixes #84).-  [Snippets]
        Added otf2ttf.py, for converting fonts from CFF to   TrueType using the googlei18n/cu2qu
        module (#802)3.4.0 (released 2016-12-21)----------------------------  [feaLib]
        Added support for generating FEA text from abstract syntax   tree (AST) objects
        (#776). Thanks @mhosken-  Added ``agl.toUnicode`` function to convert AGL-compliant
        glyph names   to Unicode strings (#774)-  Implemented MVAR table (b4d5381)3.3.1
        (released 2016-12-15)----------------------------  [setup] We no longer use
        versioneer.py to compute fonttools version   from git metadata, as this has
        caused issues for some users (#767).   Now we bump the version strings manually
        with a custom ``release``   command of setup.py script.3.3.0 (released 2016-12-06)----------------------------
        \ [ttLib] Implemented STAT table from OpenType 1.8 (#758)-  [cffLib] Fixed
        decompilation of CFF fonts containing non-standard   key/value pairs in FontDict
        (issue #740; PR #744)-  [py23] minor: in ``round3`` function, allow the second
        argument to be   ``None`` (#757)-  The standalone ``sstruct`` and ``xmlWriter``
        modules, deprecated   since vesion 3.2.0, have been removed. They can be imported
        from the   ``fontTools.misc`` package.3.2.3 (released 2016-12-02)----------------------------
        \ [py23] optimized performance of round3 function; added backport for   py35
        math.isclose() (9d8dacb)-  [subset] fixed issue with 'narrow' (UCS-2) Python
        2 builds and   ``--text``/``--text-file`` options containing non-BMP chararcters
        \  (16d0e5e)-  [varLib] fixed issuewhen normalizing location values (8fa2ee1,
        #749)-  [inspect] Made it compatible with both python2 and python3 (167ee60,
        \  #748). Thanks @pnemade3.2.2 (released 2016-11-24)----------------------------
        \ [varLib] Do not emit null axes in fvar (1bebcec). Thanks @robmck-ms-  [varLib]
        Handle fonts without GPOS (7915a45)-  [merge] Ignore LangSys if None (a11bc56)-
        \ [subset] Fix subsetting MathVariants (78d3cbe)-  [OS/2] Fix \"Private Use
        (plane 15)\" range (08a0d55). Thanks @mashabow3.2.1 (released 2016-11-03)----------------------------
        \ [OS/2] fix checking ``fsSelection`` bits matching ``head.macStyle``   bits-
        \ [varLib] added ``--build-HVAR`` option to generate ``HVAR`` table for   fonts
        with TrueType outlines. For ``CFF2``, it is enabled by default.3.2.0 (released
        2016-11-02)----------------------------  [varLib] Improve support for OpenType
        1.8 Variable Fonts:-  Implement GDEF's VariationStore-  Implement HVAR/VVAR
        tables-  Partial support for loading MutatorMath .designspace files with   varLib.designspace
        module-  Add varLib.models with Variation fonts interpolation models-  Implement
        GSUB/GPOS FeatureVariations-  Initial support for interpolating and merging
        OpenType Layout tables   (see ``varLib.interpolate_layout`` and ``varLib.merger``
        modules)-  [API change] Change version to be an integer instead of a float
        in   XML output for GSUB, GPOS, GDEF, MATH, BASE, JSTF, HVAR, VVAR, feat,
        \  hhea and vhea tables. Scripts that set the Version for those to 1.0   or
        other float values also need fixing. A warning is emitted when   code or XML
        needs fix.-  several bug fixes to the cffLib module, contributed by Adobe's
        \  @readroberts-  The XML output for CFF table now has a 'major' and 'minor'
        elements   for specifying whether it's version 1.0 or 2.0 (support for CFF2
        is   coming soon)-  [setup.py] remove undocumented/deprecated ``extra_path``
        Distutils   argument. This means that we no longer create a \"FontTools\"
        subfolder   in site-packages containing the actual fontTools package, as well
        as   the standalone xmlWriter and sstruct modules. The latter modules are
        \  also deprecated, and scheduled for removal in upcoming releases.   Please
        change your import statements to point to from fontTools.misc   import xmlWriter
        and from fontTools.misc import sstruct.-  [scripts] Add a 'fonttools' command-line
        tool that simply runs   ``fontTools.*`` sub-modules: e.g. ``fonttools ttx``,
        \  ``fonttools subset``, etc.-  [hmtx/vmts] Read advance width/heights as
        unsigned short (uint16);   automatically round float values to integers.-
        \ [ttLib/xmlWriter] add 'newlinestr=None' keyword argument to   ``TTFont.saveXML``
        for overriding os-specific line endings (passed on   to ``XMLWriter`` instances).-
        \ [versioning] Use versioneer instead of ``setuptools_scm`` to   dynamically
        load version info from a git checkout at import time.-  [feaLib] Support backslash-prefixed
        glyph names.3.1.2 (released 2016-09-27)----------------------------  restore
        Makefile as an alternative way to build/check/install-  README.md: update
        instructions for installing package from source,   and for running test suite-
        \ NEWS: Change log was out of sync with tagged release3.1.1 (released 2016-09-27)----------------------------
        \ Fix ``ttLibVersion`` attribute in TTX files still showing '3.0'   instead
        of '3.1'.-  Use ``setuptools_scm`` to manage package versions.3.1.0 (released
        2016-09-26)----------------------------  [feaLib] New library to parse and
        compile Adobe FDK OpenType Feature   files.-  [mtiLib] New library to parse
        and compile Monotype 'FontDame'   OpenType Layout Tables files.-  [voltLib]
        New library to parse Microsoft VOLT project files.-  [otlLib] New library
        to work with OpenType Layout tables.-  [varLib] New library to work with OpenType
        Font Variations.-  [pens] Add ttGlyphPen to draw to TrueType glyphs, and t2CharStringPen
        \  to draw to Type 2 Charstrings (CFF); add areaPen and perimeterPen.-  [ttLib.tables]
        Implement 'meta' and 'trak' tables.-  [ttx] Add --flavor option for compiling
        to 'woff' or 'woff2'; add   ``--with-zopfli`` option to use Zopfli to compress
        WOFF 1.0 fonts.-  [subset] Support subsetting 'COLR'/'CPAL' and 'CBDT'/'CBLC'
        color   fonts tables, and 'gvar' table for variation fonts.-  [Snippets] Add
        ``symfont.py``, for symbolic font statistics analysis;   interpolatable.py,
        a preliminary script for detecting interpolation   errors; ``{merge,dump}_woff_metadata.py``.-
        \ [classifyTools] Helpers to classify things into classes.-  [CI] Run tests
        on Windows, Linux and macOS using Appveyor and Travis   CI; check unit test
        coverage with Coverage.py/Coveralls; automatic   deployment to PyPI on tags.-
        \ [loggingTools] Use Python built-in logging module to print messages.-  [py23]
        Make round() behave like Python 3 built-in round(); define   round2() and
        round3().3.0 (released 2015-09-01)--------------------------  Add Snippet
        scripts for cmap subtable format conversion, printing   GSUB/GPOS features,
        building a GX font from two masters-  TTX WOFF2 support and a ``-f`` option
        to overwrite output file(s)-  Support GX tables: ``avar``, ``gvar``, ``fvar``,
        ``meta``-  Support ``feat`` and gzip-compressed SVG tables-  Upgrade Mac East
        Asian encodings to native implementation if   available-  Add Roman Croatian
        and Romanian encodings, codecs for mac-extended   East Asian encodings-  Implement
        optimal GLYF glyph outline packing; disabled by default2.5 (released 2014-09-24)--------------------------
        \ Add a Qt pen-  Add VDMX table converter-  Load all OpenType sub-structures
        lazily-  Add support for cmap format 13.-  Add pyftmerge tool-  Update to
        Unicode 6.3.0d3-  Add pyftinspect tool-  Add support for Google CBLC/CBDT
        color bitmaps, standard EBLC/EBDT   embedded bitmaps, and ``SVG`` table (thanks
        to Read Roberts at Adobe)-  Add support for loading, saving and ttx'ing WOFF
        file format-  Add support for Microsoft COLR/CPAL layered color glyphs-  Support
        PyPy-  Support Jython, by replacing numpy with array/lists modules and   removed
        it, pure-Python StringIO, not cStringIO-  Add pyftsubset and Subsetter object,
        supporting CFF and TTF-  Add to ttx args for -q for quiet mode, -z to choose
        a bitmap dump   format2.4 (released 2013-06-22)--------------------------
        \ Option to write to arbitrary files-  Better dump format for DSIG-  Better
        detection of OTF XML-  Fix issue with Apple's kern table format-  Fix mangling
        of TT glyph programs-  Fix issues related to mona.ttf-  Fix Windows Installer
        instructions-  Fix some modern MacOS issues-  Fix minor issues and typos2.3
        (released 2009-11-08)--------------------------  TrueType Collection (TTC)
        support-  Python 2.6 support-  Update Unicode data to 5.2.0-  Couple of bug
        fixes2.2 (released 2008-05-18)--------------------------  ClearType support-
        \ cmap format 1 support-  PFA font support-  Switched from Numeric to numpy-
        \ Update Unicode data to 5.1.0-  Update AGLFN data to 1.6-  Many bug fixes2.1
        (released 2008-01-28)--------------------------  Many years worth of fixes
        and features2.0b2 (released 2002-??-??)----------------------------  Be \"forgiving\"
        when interpreting the maxp table version field:   interpret any value as 1.0
        if it's not 0.5. Fixes dumping of these   GPL fonts: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/chinese/wangttf-
        \ Fixed ttx -l: it turned out this part of the code didn't work with   Python
        2.2.1 and earlier. My bad to do most of my testing with a   different version
        than I shipped TTX with :-(-  Fixed bug in ClassDef format 1 subtable (Andreas
        Seidel bumped into   this one).2.0b1 (released 2002-09-10)----------------------------
        \ Fixed embarrassing bug: the master checksum in the head table is now   calculated
        correctly even on little-endian platforms (such as Intel).-  Made the cmap
        format 4 compiler smarter: the binary data it creates   is now more or less
        as compact as possible. TTX now makes more   compact data than in any shipping
        font I've tested it with.-  Dump glyph names as a separate \"GlyphOrder\"
        pseudo table as opposed   to as part of the glyf table (obviously needed for
        CFF-OTF's).-  Added proper support for the CFF table.-  Don't barf on empty
        tables (questionable, but \"there are font out   there...\")-  When writing
        TT glyf data, align glyphs on 4-byte boundaries. This   seems to be the current
        recommendation by MS. Also: don't barf on   fonts which are already 4-byte
        aligned.-  Windows installer contributed bu Adam Twardoch! Yay!-  Changed
        the command line interface again, now by creating one new   tool replacing
        the old ones: ttx It dumps and compiles, depending on   input file types.
        The options have changed somewhat.-  The -d option is back (output dir)-  ttcompile's
        -i options is now called -m (as in \"merge\"), to avoid   clash with dump's
        -i.-  The -s option (\"split tables\") no longer creates a directory, but
        \  instead outputs a small .ttx file containing references to the   individual
        table files. This is not a true link, it's a simple file   name, and the referenced
        file should be in the same directory so   ttcompile can find them.-  compile
        no longer accepts a directory as input argument. Instead it   can parse the
        new \"mini-ttx\" format as output by \"ttx -s\".-  all arguments are input
        files-  Renamed the command line programs and moved them to the Tools   subdirectory.
        They are now installed by the setup.py install script.-  Added OpenType support.
        BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and JSTF are (almost)   fully supported. The XML output
        is not yet final, as I'm still   considering to output certain subtables in
        a more human-friendly   manner.-  Fixed 'kern' table to correctly accept subtables
        it doesn't know   about, as well as interpreting Apple's definition of the
        'kern' table   headers correctly.-  Fixed bug where glyphnames were not calculated
        from 'cmap' if it was   (one of the) first tables to be decompiled. More specifically:
        it   cmap was the first to ask for a glyphID -> glyphName mapping.-  Switched
        XML parsers: use expat instead of xmlproc. Should be faster.-  Removed my
        UnicodeString object: I now require Python 2.0 or up,   which has unicode
        support built in.-  Removed assert in glyf table: redundant data at the end
        of the table   is now ignored instead of raising an error. Should become a
        warning.-  Fixed bug in hmtx/vmtx code that only occured if all advances were
        \  equal.-  Fixed subtle bug in TT instruction disassembler.-  Couple of fixes
        to the 'post' table.-  Updated OS/2 table to latest spec.1.0b1 (released 2001-08-10)----------------------------
        \ Reorganized the command line interface for ttDump.py and   ttCompile.py,
        they now behave more like \"normal\" command line tool,   in that they accept
        multiple input files for batch processing.-  ttDump.py and ttCompile.py don't
        silently override files anymore, but   ask before doing so. Can be overridden
        by -f.-  Added -d option to both ttDump.py and ttCompile.py.-  Installation
        is now done with distutils. (Needs work for environments   without compilers.)-
        \ Updated installation instructions.-  Added some workarounds so as to handle
        certain buggy fonts more   gracefully.-  Updated Unicode table to Unicode
        3.0 (Thanks Antoine!)-  Included a Python script by Adam Twardoch that adds
        some useful stuff   to the Windows registry.-  Moved the project to SourceForge.1.0a6
        (released 2000-03-15)----------------------------  Big reorganization: made
        ttLib a subpackage of the new fontTools   package, changed several module
        names. Called the entire suite   \"FontTools\"-  Added several submodules
        to fontTools, some new, some older.-  Added experimental CFF/GPOS/GSUB support
        to ttLib, read-only (but XML   dumping of GPOS/GSUB is for now disabled)-
        \ Fixed hdmx endian bug-  Added -b option to ttCompile.py, it disables recalculation
        of   bounding boxes, as requested by Werner Lemberg.-  Renamed tt2xml.pt to
        ttDump.py and xml2tt.py to ttCompile.py-  Use \".ttx\" as file extension instead
        of \".xml\".-  TTX is now the name of the XML-based *format* for TT fonts,
        and not   just an application.1.0a5-----Never released-  More tables supported:
        hdmx, vhea, vmtx1.0a3 & 1.0a4-------------Never released-  fixed most portability
        issues-  retracted the \"Euro_or_currency\" change from 1.0a2: it was   nonsense!1.0a2
        (released 1999-05-02)----------------------------  binary release for MacOS-
        \ genenates full FOND resources: including width table, PS font name   info
        and kern table if applicable.-  added cmap format 4 support. Extra: dumps
        Unicode char names as XML   comments!-  added cmap format 6 support-  now
        accepts true type files starting with \"true\" (instead of just   0x00010000
        and \"OTTO\")-  'glyf' table support is now complete: I added support for
        composite   scale, xy-scale and two-by-two for the 'glyf' table. For now,
        \  component offset scale behaviour defaults to Apple-style. This only   affects
        the (re)calculation of the glyph bounding box.-  changed \"Euro\" to \"Euro_or_currency\"
        in the Standard Apple Glyph   order list, since we cannot tell from the 'post'
        table which is   meant. I should probably doublecheck with a Unicode encoding
        if   available. (This does not affect the output!)Fixed bugs: - 'hhea' table
        is now recalculated correctly - fixed wrongassumption about sfnt resource
        names1.0a1 (released 1999-04-27)----------------------------  initial binary
        release for MacOS"

        [Gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide): A peek into the future\u2026I
        started working on GitPython in 2009, back in the days when Python was 'my
        thing' and I had great plans with it.Of course, back in the days, I didn't
        really know what I was doing and this shows in many places. Somewhat similar
        toPython this happens to be 'good enough', but at the same time is deeply
        flawed and broken beyond repair.By now, GitPython is widely used and I am
        sure there is a good reason for that, it's something to be proud of and happy
        about.The community is maintaining the software and is keeping it relevant
        for which I am absolutely grateful. For the time to come I am happy to continue
        maintaining GitPython, remaining hopeful that one day it won't be needed anymore.More
        than 15 years after my first meeting with 'git' I am still in excited about
        it, and am happy to finally have the tools andprobably the skills to scratch
        that itch of mine: implement `git` in a way that makes tool creation a piece
        of cake for most.If you like the idea and want to learn more, please head
        over to [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide), animplementation of
        'git' in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).*(Please note that `gitoxide` is
        not currently available for use in Python, and that Rust is required.)*##
        GitPythonGitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories,
        high-level like git-porcelain,or low-level like git-plumbing.It provides abstractions
        of git objects for easy access of repository data often backed by calling
        the `git`command-line program.### DEVELOPMENT STATUSThis project is in **maintenance
        mode**, which means that- \u2026there will be no feature development, unless
        these are contributed- \u2026there will be no bug fixes, unless they are relevant
        to the safety of users, or contributed- \u2026issues will be responded to
        with waiting times of up to a monthThe project is open to contributions of
        all kinds, as well as new maintainers.### REQUIREMENTSGitPython needs the
        `git` executable to be installed on the system and available in your`PATH`
        for most operations. If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find
        itby setting the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.-
        Git (1.7.x or newer)- Python >= 3.7The list of dependencies are listed in
        `./requirements.txt` and `./test-requirements.txt`.The installer takes care
        of installing them for you.### INSTALLGitPython and its required package dependencies
        can be installed in any of the following ways, all of which should typically
        be done in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).####
        From PyPITo obtain and install a copy [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/),
        run:```shpip install GitPython```(A distribution package can also be downloaded
        for manual installation at [the PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/).)####
        From downloaded source codeIf you have downloaded the source code, run this
        from inside the unpacked `GitPython` directory:```shpip install .```#### By
        cloning the source code repositoryTo clone the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython)
        from source to work on the code, you can do it like so:```shgit clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPythoncd
        GitPython./init-tests-after-clone.sh```On Windows, `./init-tests-after-clone.sh`
        can be run in a Git Bash shell.If you are cloning [your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks),
        then replace the above `git clone` command with one that gives the URL of
        your fork. Or use this [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) command (assuming you
        have `gh` and your fork is called `GitPython`):```shgh repo clone GitPython```Having
        cloned the repo, create and activate your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).Then
        make an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs):```shpip
        install -e \".[test]\"```In the less common case that you do not want to install
        test dependencies, `pip install -e .` can be used instead.#### With editable
        *dependencies* (not preferred, and rarely needed)In rare cases, you may want
        to work on GitPython and one or both of its [gitdb](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitdb)
        and [smmap](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap) dependencies at
        the same time, with changes in your local working copy of gitdb or smmap immediatley
        reflected in the behavior of your local working copy of GitPython. This can
        be done by making editable installations of those dependencies in the same
        virtual environment where you install GitPython.If you want to do that *and*
        you want the versions in GitPython's git submodules to be used, then pass
        `-e git/ext/gitdb` and/or `-e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap` to `pip install`.
        This can be done in any order, and in separate `pip install` commands or the
        same one, so long as `-e` appears before *each* path. For example, you can
        install GitPython, gitdb, and smmap editably in the currently active virtual
        environment this way:```shpip install -e \".[test]\" -e git/ext/gitdb -e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap```The
        submodules must have been cloned for that to work, but that will already be
        the case if you have run `./init-tests-after-clone.sh`. You can use `pip list`
        to check which packages are installed editably and which are installed normally.To
        reiterate, this approach should only rarely be used. For most development
        it is preferable to allow the gitdb and smmap dependencices to be retrieved
        automatically from PyPI in their latest stable packaged versions.### Limitations####
        Leakage of System ResourcesGitPython is not suited for long-running processes
        (like daemons) as it tends toleak system resources. It was written in a time
        where destructors (as implementedin the `__del__` method) still ran deterministically.In
        case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to search thecodebase
        for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself when you see fit.Another
        way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython into aseparate
        process which can be dropped periodically.#### Windows supportSee [Issue #525](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/525).###
        RUNNING TESTS_Important_: Right after cloning this repository, please be sure
        to have executedthe `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` script in the repository
        root. Otherwiseyou will encounter test failures.#### Install test dependenciesEnsure
        testing libraries are installed. This is taken care of already if you installed
        with:```shpip install -e \".[test]\"```If you had installed with a command
        like `pip install -e .` instead, you can still runthe above command to add
        the testing dependencies.#### Test commandsTo test, run:```shpytest```To lint,
        and apply some linting fixes as well as automatic code formatting, run:```shpre-commit
        run --all-files```This includes the linting and autoformatting done by Ruff,
        as well as some other checks.To typecheck, run:```shmypy```#### CI (and tox)Style
        and formatting checks, and running tests on all the different supported Python
        versions, will be performed:- Upon submitting a pull request.- On each push,
        *if* you have a fork with GitHub Actions enabled.- Locally, if you run [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/)
        (this skips any Python versions you don't have installed).#### Configuration
        filesSpecific tools are all configured in the `./pyproject.toml` file:- `pytest`
        (test runner)- `coverage.py` (code coverage)- `ruff` (linter and formatter)-
        `mypy` (type checker)Orchestration tools:- Configuration for `pre-commit`
        is in the `./.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.- Configuration for `tox` is in
        `./tox.ini`.- Configuration for GitHub Actions (CI) is in files inside `./.github/workflows/`.###

        <http://graphene-python.org>`__ is an opinionated Pythonlibrary for building
        GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.-  **Easy to use:** Graphene helps you
        use GraphQL in Python without   effort.-  **Relay:** Graphene has builtin
        support for Relay.-  **Data agnostic:** Graphene supports any kind of data
        source: SQL   (Django, SQLAlchemy), NoSQL, custom Python objects, etc. We
        believe   that by providing a complete API you could plug Graphene anywhere
        \  your data lives and make your data available through GraphQL.Integrations------------Graphene
        has multiple integrations with different frameworks:+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+|

        hub.com/graphql-python/graphene-sqlalchemy/>`__ |+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+Also,
        Graphene is fully compatible with the GraphQL spec, workingseamlessly with
        all GraphQL clients, such as`Relay <https://github.com/facebook/relay>`__,`Apollo
        <https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client>`__ and`gql <https://github.com/graphql-python/gql>`__.Installation------------To
        install `graphene`, just run this command in your shell.. code:: bash   pip
        install \"graphene>=3.0\"Examples--------Here is one example for you to get
        started:.. code:: python   import graphene   class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
        \      hello = graphene.String(description='A typical hello world')       def
        resolve_hello(self, info):           return 'World'   schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)Then
        Querying ``graphene.Schema`` is as simple as:.. code:: python   query = '''
        \      query SayHello {         hello       }   '''   result = schema.execute(query)If
        you want to learn even more, you can also check the following`examples <examples/>`__:-
        \ **Basic Schema**: `Starwars example <examples/starwars>`__-  **Relay Schema**:
        `Starwars Relay   example <examples/starwars_relay>`__Documentation-------------Documentation
        and links to additional resources are available athttps://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/Contributing------------After
        cloning this repo, create a`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__
        and ensuredependencies are installed by running:.. code:: sh   virtualenv
        venv   source venv/bin/activate   pip install -e \".[test]\"Well-written tests
        and maintaining good test coverage is important tothis project. While developing,
        run new and existing tests with:.. code:: sh   py.test graphene/relay/tests/test_node.py
        # Single file   py.test graphene/relay # All tests in directoryAdd the ``-s``
        flag if you have introduced breakpoints into the code fordebugging. Add the
        ``-v`` (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDverbose\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD) flag to get more detailed
        testoutput. For even more detailed output, use ``-vv``. Check out the`pytest
        documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__ for moreoptions and
        test running controls.You can also run the benchmarks with:.. code:: sh   py.test
        graphene --benchmark-onlyGraphene supports several versions of Python. To
        make sure that changesdo not break compatibility with any of those versions,
        we use ``tox`` tocreate virtualenvs for each Python version and run tests
        with thatversion. To run against all Python versions defined in the ``tox.ini``config
        file, just run:.. code:: sh   toxIf you wish to run against a specific version
        defined in the ``tox.ini``file:.. code:: sh   tox -e py36Tox can only use
        whatever versions of Python are installed on yoursystem. When you create a
        pull request, Travis will also be running thesame tests and report the results,
        so there is no need for potentialcontributors to try to install every single
        version of Python on theirown system ahead of time. We appreciate opening
        issues and pull requeststo make graphene even more stable & useful!Building

        excellent`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and a custom theme.An HTML
        version of the documentation is produced by running:.. code:: sh   make docs..

        comprises areplication of the complete test suite of GraphQL.js, making sure
        this port isreliable and compatible with GraphQL.js.Note that for various
        reasons, GraphQL-core does not use SemVer like GraphQL.js. Increases in the
        major version of GraphQL.js are reflected in the minor version of GraphQL-core
        instead. This means there can be breaking changes in the API when the minor
        version changes, and only patch releases are fully backward compatible. Therefore,
        we recommend something like `=~ 3.2.0` as version specifier when including
        GraphQL-core as a dependency.## DocumentationA more detailed documentation
        for GraphQL-core 3 can be found at[graphql-core-3.readthedocs.io](https://graphql-core-3.readthedocs.io/).The
        documentation for GraphQL.js can be found at [graphql.org/graphql-js/](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/).The
        documentation for GraphQL itself can be found at [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/).There
        will be also [blog articles](https://cito.github.io/tags/graphql/) with more
        usageexamples.## Getting startedA general overview of GraphQL is available
        in the[README](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/README.md)
        for the[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec).
        That overviewdescribes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](tests)
        in thisrepository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk
        through thatREADME and the corresponding tests in parallel.## InstallationGraphQL-core
        3 can be installed from PyPI using the built-in pip command:    python -m
        pip install graphql-coreYou can also use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)
        for installation in avirtual environment:    poetry install## UsageGraphQL-core
        provides two important capabilities: building a type schema andserving queries
        against that type schema.First, build a GraphQL type schema which maps to
        your codebase:```pythonfrom graphql import (    GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType,
        GraphQLField, GraphQLString)schema = GraphQLSchema(    query=GraphQLObjectType(        name=''RootQueryType'',        fields={            ''hello'':
        GraphQLField(                GraphQLString,                resolve=lambda
        obj, info: ''world'')        }))```This defines a simple schema, with one
        type and one field, that resolves to a fixedvalue. The `resolve` function
        can return a value, a co-routine object or a list ofthese. It takes two positional
        arguments; the first one provides the root or theresolved parent field, the
        second one provides a `GraphQLResolveInfo` object whichcontains information
        about the execution state of the query, including a `context`attribute holding
        per-request state such as authentication information or databasesession. Any
        GraphQL arguments are passed to the `resolve` functions as individualkeyword
        arguments.Note that the signature of the resolver functions is a bit different
        in GraphQL.js,where the context is passed separately and arguments are passed
        as a single object.Also note that GraphQL fields must be passed as a `GraphQLField`
        object explicitly.Similarly, GraphQL arguments must be passed as `GraphQLArgument`
        objects.A more complex example is included in the top-level [tests](tests)
        directory.Then, serve the result of a query against that type schema.```pythonfrom
        graphql import graphql_syncsource = ''{ hello }''print(graphql_sync(schema,
        source))```This runs a query fetching the one field defined, and then prints
        the result:```pythonExecutionResult(data={''hello'': ''world''}, errors=None)```The
        `graphql_sync` function will first ensure the query is syntactically andsemantically
        valid before executing it, reporting errors otherwise.```pythonfrom graphql
        import graphql_syncsource = ''{ BoyHowdy }''print(graphql_sync(schema, source))```Because
        we queried a non-existing field, we will get the following result:```pythonExecutionResult(data=None,
        errors=[GraphQLError(    "Cannot query field ''BoyHowdy'' on type ''RootQueryType''.",    locations=[SourceLocation(line=1,
        column=3)])])```The `graphql_sync` function assumes that all resolvers return
        values synchronously. Byusing coroutines as resolvers, you can also create
        results in an asynchronous fashionwith the `graphql` function.```pythonimport
        asynciofrom graphql import (    graphql, GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType,
        GraphQLField, GraphQLString)async def resolve_hello(obj, info):    await asyncio.sleep(3)    return
        ''world''schema = GraphQLSchema(    query=GraphQLObjectType(        name=''RootQueryType'',        fields={            ''hello'':
        GraphQLField(                GraphQLString,                resolve=resolve_hello)        }))async
        def main():    query = ''{ hello }''    print(''Fetching the result...'')    result
        = await graphql(schema, query)    print(result)asyncio.run(main())```## Goals
        and restrictionsGraphQL-core tries to reproduce the code of the reference
        implementation GraphQL.jsin Python as closely as possible and to stay up-to-date
        with the latest development ofGraphQL.js.GraphQL-core 3 (formerly known as
        GraphQL-core-next) has been created as a modernalternative to [GraphQL-core
        2](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-legacy),a prior work by
        Syrus Akbary, based on an older version of GraphQL.js and alsotargeting older
        Python versions. Some parts of GraphQL-core 3 have been inspired byGraphQL-core
        2 or directly taken over with only slight modifications, but most of thecode
        has been re-implemented from scratch, replicating the latest code in GraphQL.jsvery
        closely and adding type hints for Python.Design goals for the GraphQL-core
        3 library were:* to be a simple, cruft-free, state-of-the-art GraphQL implementation
        for current  Python versions* to be very close to the GraphQL.js reference
        implementation, while still providing  a Pythonic API and code style* to make
        extensive use of Python type hints, similar to how GraphQL.js used Flow  (and
        is now using TypeScript)* to use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to
        achieve a consistent code style  while saving time and mental energy for more
        important matters* to replicate the complete Mocha-based test suite of GraphQL.js  using
        [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)  with [pytest-describe](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-describe/)Some
        restrictions (mostly in line with the design goals):* requires Python 3.6
        or newer* does not support some already deprecated methods and options of
        GraphQL.js* supports asynchronous operations only via async.io  (does not
        support the additional executors in GraphQL-core)## Integration with other
        libraries and roadmap* [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/) is a more high-level
        framework for building  GraphQL APIs in Python, and there is already a whole
        ecosystem of libraries, server  integrations and tools built on top of Graphene.
        Most of this Graphene ecosystem has  also been created by Syrus Akbary, who
        meanwhile has handed over the maintenance  and future development to members
        of the GraphQL-Python community.  The current version 2 of Graphene is using
        Graphql-core 2 as core library for much of  the heavy lifting. Note that Graphene
        2 is not compatible with GraphQL-core 3.  The  new version 3 of Graphene will
        use GraphQL-core 3 instead of GraphQL-core 2.* [Ariadne](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne)
        is a Python library for implementing  GraphQL servers using schema-first approach
        created by Mirumee Software.  Ariadne is already using GraphQL-core 3 as its
        GraphQL implementation.* [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry),
        created by Patrick  Arminio, is a new GraphQL library for Python 3, inspired
        by dataclasses,  that is also using GraphQL-core 3 as underpinning.## ChangelogChanges
        are tracked as[GitHub releases](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/releases).##
        Credits and historyThe GraphQL-core 3 library* has been created and is maintained
        by Christoph Zwerschke* uses ideas and code from GraphQL-core 2, a prior work
        by Syrus Akbary* is a Python port of GraphQL.js which has been developed by
        Lee Byron and others  at Facebook, Inc. and is now maintained  by the [GraphQL
        foundation](https://gql.foundation/join/)Please watch the recording of Lee
        Byron''s short keynote on the[history of GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjHWkBr3tjI)at
        the open source leadership summit 2019 to better understandhow and why GraphQL
        was created at Facebook and then became open sourcedand ported to many different
        programming languages.## LicenseGraphQL-core 3 is[MIT-licensed](./LICENSE),just

        Getting StartedA basic understanding of GraphQL and of the GraphQL Python
        implementation is neededto provide context for this library.An overview of
        GraphQL in general is available in the[README](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/blob/master/README.md)
        for the[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core).This
        library is designed to work with thethe [GraphQL-Core](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core)Python
        reference implementation of a GraphQL server.An overview of the functionality
        that a Relay-compliant GraphQL server should provideis in the [GraphQL Relay
        Specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-relay-specification.html)on
        the [Relay website](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).That overview describes
        a simple set of examples that existas [tests](tests) in this repository.A
        good way to get started with this repository is to walk through that documentationand
        the corresponding tests in this library together.## Using Relay Library for
        GraphQL Python (graphql-core)Install Relay Library for GraphQL Python```shpip
        install graphql-corepip install graphql-relay```When building a schema for
        [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core),the provided library
        functions can be used to simplify the creation of Relay patterns.All the functions
        that are explained in the following sections must beimported from the top
        level of the `graphql_relay` package, like this:```pythonfrom graphql_relay
        import connection_definitions```### ConnectionsHelper functions are provided
        for both building the GraphQL typesfor connections and for implementing the
        `resolve` method for fieldsreturning those types. - `connection_args` returns
        the arguments that fields should provide whenthey return a connection type
        that supports bidirectional pagination. - `forward_connection_args` returns
        the arguments that fields should provide whenthey return a connection type
        that only supports forward pagination. - `backward_connection_args` returns
        the arguments that fields should provide whenthey return a connection type
        that only supports backward pagination. - `connection_definitions` returns
        a `connection_type` and its associated`edgeType`, given a name and a node
        type. - `connection_from_array` is a helper method that takes an array and
        thearguments from `connection_args`, does pagination and filtering, and returnsan
        object in the shape expected by a `connection_type`''s `resolve` function.
        - `cursor_for_object_in_connection` is a helper method that takes an array
        and amember object, and returns a cursor for use in the mutation payload.
        - `offset_to_cursor` takes the index of a member object in an array and returns
        an opaque cursor for use in the mutation payload. - `cursor_to_offset` takes
        an opaque cursor (created with `offset_to_cursor`)and returns the corresponding
        array index.An example usage of these methods from the [test schema](tests/star_wars_schema.py):```pythonship_edge,
        ship_connection = connection_definitions(ship_type, "Ship")faction_type =
        GraphQLObjectType(    name="Faction",    description="A faction in the Star
        Wars saga",    fields=lambda: {        "id": global_id_field("Faction"),        "name":
        GraphQLField(GraphQLString, description="The name of the faction."),        "ships":
        GraphQLField(            ship_connection,            description="The ships
        used by the faction.",            args=connection_args,            resolve=lambda
        faction, _info, **args: connection_from_array(                [get_ship(ship)
        for ship in faction.ships], args            ),        ),    },    interfaces=[node_interface],)```This
        shows adding a `ships` field to the `Faction` object that is a connection.It
        uses `connection_definitions(ship_type, "Ship")` to create the connectiontype,
        adds `connection_args` as arguments on this function, and then implementsthe
        resolver function by passing the array of ships and the arguments to`connection_from_array`.###
        Object IdentificationHelper functions are provided for both building the GraphQL
        typesfor nodes and for implementing global IDs around local IDs. - `node_definitions`
        returns the `Node` interface that objects can implement,    and returns the
        `node` root field to include on the query type.    To implement this, it takes
        a function to resolve an ID to an object,    and to determine the type of
        a given object. - `to_global_id` takes a type name and an ID specific to that
        type name,    and returns a "global ID" that is unique among all types. -
        `from_global_id` takes the "global ID" created by `to_global_id`, and    returns
        the type name and ID used to create it. - `global_id_field` creates the configuration
        for an `id` field on a node. - `plural_identifying_root_field` creates a field
        that accepts a list of    non-ID identifiers (like a username) and maps then
        to their corresponding    objects.An example usage of these methods from the
        [test schema](tests/star_wars_schema.py):```pythondef get_node(global_id,
        _info):    type_, id_ = from_global_id(global_id)    if type_ == "Faction":        return
        get_faction(id_)    if type_ == "Ship":        return get_ship(id_)    return
        None  # pragma: no coverdef get_node_type(obj, _info, _type):    if isinstance(obj,
        Faction):        return faction_type.name    return ship_type.namenode_interface,
        node_field = node_definitions(get_node, get_node_type)[:2]faction_type = GraphQLObjectType(    name="Faction",    description="A
        faction in the Star Wars saga",    fields=lambda: {        "id": global_id_field("Faction"),        "name":
        GraphQLField(GraphQLString, description="The name of the faction."),        "ships":
        GraphQLField(            ship_connection,            description="The ships
        used by the faction.",            args=connection_args,            resolve=lambda
        faction, _info, **args: connection_from_array(                [get_ship(ship)
        for ship in faction.ships], args            ),        ),    },    interfaces=[node_interface],)query_type
        = GraphQLObjectType(    name="Query",    fields=lambda: {        "rebels":
        GraphQLField(faction_type, resolve=lambda _obj, _info: get_rebels()),        "empire":
        GraphQLField(faction_type, resolve=lambda _obj, _info: get_empire()),        "node":
        node_field,    },)```This uses `node_definitions` to construct the `Node`
        interface and the `node`field; it uses `from_global_id` to resolve the IDs
        passed in the implementationof the function mapping ID to object. It then
        uses the `global_id_field` method tocreate the `id` field on `Faction`, which
        also ensures implements the`node_interface`. Finally, it adds the `node` field
        to the query type, using the`node_field` returned by `node_definitions`.###
        MutationsA helper function is provided for building mutations withsingle inputs
        and client mutation IDs. - `mutation_with_client_mutation_id` takes a name,
        input fields, output fields,and a mutation method to map from the input fields
        to the output fields,performing the mutation along the way. It then creates
        and returns a fieldconfiguration that can be used as a top-level field on
        the mutation type.An example usage of these methods from the [test schema](tests/star_wars_schema.py):```pythonclass
        IntroduceShipMutation:    def __init__(self, shipId, factionId, clientMutationId=None):        self.shipId
        = shipId        self.factionId = factionId        self.clientMutationId =
        clientMutationIddef mutate_and_get_payload(_info, shipName, factionId, **_input):    new_ship
        = create_ship(shipName, factionId)    return IntroduceShipMutation(shipId=new_ship.id,
        factionId=factionId)ship_mutation = mutation_with_client_mutation_id(    "IntroduceShip",    input_fields={        "shipName":
        GraphQLInputField(GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)),        "factionId": GraphQLInputField(GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID)),    },    output_fields={        "ship":
        GraphQLField(            ship_type, resolve=lambda payload, _info: get_ship(payload.shipId)        ),        "faction":
        GraphQLField(            faction_type, resolve=lambda payload, _info: get_faction(payload.factionId)        ),    },    mutate_and_get_payload=mutate_and_get_payload,)mutation_type
        = GraphQLObjectType(    "Mutation", fields=lambda: {"introduceShip": ship_mutation})```This
        code creates a mutation named `IntroduceShip`, which takes a factionID and
        a ship name as input. It outputs the `Faction` and the `Ship` inquestion.
        `mutate_and_get_payload` then gets each input field as keywordparameter, performs
        the mutation by constructing the new ship, then returnsan object that will
        be resolved by the output fields.Our mutation type then creates the `introduceShip`
        field using the returnvalue of `mutation_with_client_mutation_id`.## ContributingAfter
        cloning this repository from GitHub,we recommend using [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)to
        create a test environment. With poetry installed,you do this with the following
        command:```shpoetry install```You can then run the complete test suite like
        this:```shpoetry run pytest```In order to run only a part of the tests with
        increased verbosity,you can add pytest options, like this:```shpoetry run
        pytest tests/node -vv```In order to check the code style with flake8, use
        this:```shpoetry run flake8```Use the `tox` command to run the test suite
        with differentPython versions and perform all additional source code checks.You
        can also restrict tox to an individual environment, like this:```shpoetry
        run tox -e py39```'

      Description: '.. This file is included into docs/history.rstGreenlets are lightweight
        coroutines for in-process concurrentprogramming.The "greenlet" package is
        a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version ofCPython that supports micro-threads
        called "tasklets". Tasklets runpseudo-concurrently (typically in a single
        or a few OS-level threads)and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".A
        "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion ofmicro-thread
        with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.This is useful when
        you want to control exactly when your code runs.You can build custom scheduled
        micro-threads on top of greenlet;however, it seems that greenlets are useful
        on their own as a way tomake advanced control flow structures. For example,
        we can recreategenerators; the difference with Python''s own generators is
        that ourgenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions canyield
        values too. (Additionally, you don''t need a "yield" keyword. Seethe example
        in `test_generator.py<https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/blob/adca19bf1f287b3395896a8f41f3f4fd1797fdc7/src/greenlet/tests/test_generator.py#L1>`_).Greenlets
        are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodifiedinterpreter...

      Description: "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)=====================================================Support
        for the Internationalized Domain Names inApplications (IDNA) protocol as specified
        in `RFC 5891<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_. This is the latest version
        ofthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as \u201CIDNA 2008\u201D.This
        library also provides support for Unicode TechnicalStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA
        Compatibility Processing<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.This acts as
        a suitable replacement for the \u201Cencodings.idna\u201Dmodule that comes
        with the Python standard library, but whichonly supports the older superseded
        IDNA specification (`RFC 3490<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).Basic
        functions are simply executed:.. code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna    >>>
        idna.encode('\u30C9\u30E1\u30A4\u30F3.\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8')    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'
        \   >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))    \u30C9\u30E1\u30A4\u30F3.\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8Installation------------This
        package is available for installation from PyPI:.. code-block:: bash    $
        python3 -m pip install idnaUsage-----For typical usage, the ``encode`` and
        ``decode`` functions will take adomain name argument and perform a conversion
        to A-labels or U-labelsrespectively... code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna
        \   >>> idna.encode('\u30C9\u30E1\u30A4\u30F3.\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8')    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'
        \   >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))    \u30C9\u30E1\u30A4\u30F3.\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8You
        may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the``idna.codec`` module:..
        code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna.codec    >>> print('\u0434\u043E\u043C\u0435\u043D.\u0438\u0441\u043F\u044B\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0438\u0435'.encode('idna2008'))
        \   b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna2008'))

        can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or``alabel`` functions
        if necessary:.. code-block:: pycon    >>> idna.alabel('\u6D4B\u8BD5')    b'xn--0zwm56d'Compatibility
        Mapping (UTS #46)+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++As described in `RFC 5895
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, theIDNA specification does not normalize
        input from different potentialways a user may input a domain name. This functionality,
        known asa \u201Cmapping\u201D, is considered by the specification to be a
        localuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.This
        library provides one such mapping that was developed by theUnicode Consortium.
        Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_,
        it provides for both a regularmapping for typical applications, as well as
        a transitional mapping tohelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.For
        example, \u201CK\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen\u201D is not a permissible label as
        *LATINCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).UTS
        46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNAconversion...
        code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna    >>> idna.encode('K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen')
        \   ...    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen'
        not allowed    >>> idna.encode('K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen', uts46=True)    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'
        \   >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))    k\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchenTransitional
        processing provides conversions to help transition fromthe older 2003 standard
        to the current standard. For example, in theoriginal IDNA specification, the
        *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (\xDF) wasconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER
        S* (ss), whereas in the currentIDNA specification this conversion is not performed...
        code-block:: pycon    >>> idna.encode('K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen', uts46=True,
        transitional=True)    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'Implementers should use transitional
        processing with caution, only inrare cases where conversion from legacy labels
        to current labels must beperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date
        2008). For typicalapplications that just need to convert labels, transitional
        processingis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatibleresults.``encodings.idna``
        Compatibility++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Function calls from the Python
        built-in ``encodings.idna`` module aremapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents
        using the ``idna.compat`` module.Simply substitute the ``import`` clause in
        your code to refer to the newmodule name.Exceptions----------All errors raised
        during the conversion following the specificationshould raise an exception
        derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` baseclass.More specific exceptions that
        may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``when the error reflects an illegal
        combination of left-to-right andright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint``
        whena specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.INVALID);
        and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint isillegal based on
        its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJbut the contextual
        requirements are not satisfied.)Building and Diagnostics------------------------The
        IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookuptables for
        performance. These tables are derived from computing againsteligibility criteria
        in the respective standards. These tables arecomputed using the command-line
        script ``tools/idna-data``.This tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from
        the Unicode repositoryand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility.
        There arethree main modes:* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py``
        and  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and
        \ UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against
        \ a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a  different
        version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.* ``idna-data make-table``.
        Generate a table of the IDNA disposition  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO)
        in the format found in Appendix  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables
        published by `IANA  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints
        debugging output on the various  properties associated with an individual
        Unicode codepoint (in this  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA
        and UTS 46 status of a  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.The
        tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data-h``. Most
        notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specificationof the version
        of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. Forexample, ``idna-data
        --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generatelibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.Additional
        Notes----------------* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is
        published in the  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.*
        **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.  As this
        library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of  applications, many
        of which strive for broad compatibility with older  Python versions, there
        is no rush to remove older interpreter support.  Removing support for older
        versions should be well justified in that the  maintenance burden has become
        too high.* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.
        \ While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable  issues
        being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your  requirements
        file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.* **Testing**. The
        library has a test suite based on each rule of the  IDNA specification, as
        well as tests that are provided as part of the  Unicode Technical Standard
        46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.*
        **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in  this library.
        Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by  the technical standard
        IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased  out across the domain industry
        due to associated security risks. For  now, applications that need to support
        these non-compliant labels  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode
        operation in this library  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`.
        See `the Github  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more
        discussion."

        access to the functionality of`importlib.metadata <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html>`_including
        improvements added to subsequent Python versions.Compatibility=============New
        features are introduced in this third-party library and later mergedinto CPython.

      Description: 'Jinja=====Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine.
        Specialplaceholders in the template allow writing code similar to Pythonsyntax.
        Then the template is passed data to render the final document.It includes:-   Template
        inheritance and inclusion.-   Define and import macros within templates.-   HTML
        templates can use autoescaping to prevent XSS from untrusted    user input.-   A
        sandboxed environment can safely render untrusted templates.-   AsyncIO support
        for generating templates and calling async    functions.-   I18N support with
        Babel.-   Templates are compiled to optimized Python code just-in-time and    cached,
        or can be compiled ahead-of-time.-   Exceptions point to the correct line
        in templates to make debugging    easier.-   Extensible filters, tests, functions,
        and even syntax.Jinja''s philosophy is that while application logic belongs
        in Python ifpossible, it shouldn''t make the template designer''s job difficult
        byrestricting functionality too much.Installing----------Install and update

        joblib with user documentation is located on:https://joblib.readthedocs.ioGetting
        the latest code=======================To get the latest code using git, simply
        type::    git clone https://github.com/joblib/joblib.gitIf you don''t have
        git installed, you can download a zipof the latest code: https://github.com/joblib/joblib/archive/refs/heads/master.zipInstalling==========You
        can use `pip` to install joblib::    pip install joblibfrom any directory
        or::    python setup.py installfrom the source directory.Dependencies============-
        Joblib has no mandatory dependencies besides Python (supported versions are  3.8+).-
        Joblib has an optional dependency on Numpy (at least version 1.6.1) for array  manipulation.-
        Joblib includes its own vendored copy of  `loky <https://github.com/tomMoral/loky>`_
        for process management.- Joblib can efficiently dump and load numpy arrays
        but does not require numpy  to be installed.- Joblib has an optional dependency
        on  `python-lz4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lz4>`_ as a faster alternative
        to  zlib and gzip for compressed serialization.- Joblib has an optional dependency
        on psutil to mitigate memory leaks in  parallel worker processes.- Some examples
        require external dependencies such as pandas. See the  instructions in the
        `Building the docs`_ section for details.Workflow to contribute======================To
        contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github<https://github.com/>`_.
        Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository<https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_
        to have your own repository,clone it using ''git clone'' on the computers
        where you want to work. Makeyour changes in your clone, push them to your
        github account, test themon several computers, and when you are happy with
        them, send a pullrequest to the main repository.Running the test suite======================To
        run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.Run
        the test suite using::    pytest joblibfrom the root of the project.Building
        the docs=================To build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4)
        and some dependenciesinstalled::    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txtThe
        docs can then be built with the following command::    make docThe html docs
        are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.Making a source tarball=======================To
        create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run thefollowing
        command::    python setup.py sdistThe tarball will be created in the `dist`
        directory. This command willcompile the docs, and the resulting tarball can
        be installed withno extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You
        will needsetuptool and sphinx.Making a release and uploading it to PyPI=========================================This
        command is only run by project manager, to make a release, andupload in to
        PyPI::    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel    twine upload dist/*Note that
        the documentation should automatically get updated at each gitpush. If that
        is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolveany doc build error
        (in particular when running the examples).Updating the changelog======================Changes
        are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updatedbut, the
        following git command may be used to generate the lines::    git log --abbrev-commit
        --date=short --no-merges --sparse'

        StatusKiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
        solvingalgorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the`seminal
        Cassowary paper <https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf>`_.It
        is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi has been designedfrom
        the ground up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500xfaster
        than the original Cassowary solver with typical use cases gaining a 40ximprovement.
        Memory savings are consistently > 5x.In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships
        with hand-rolled Python bindings forPython 3.7+.'

      Description: '=========================Mako Templates for Python=========================Mako
        is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML syntax
        which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako''s syntax
        and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Djangotemplates,
        Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python (i.e.
        Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideasof componentized
        layout and inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and flexible
        models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python calling and
        scoping semantics.Nutshell========::    <%inherit file="base.html"/>    <%        rows
        = [[v for v in range(0,10)] for row in range(0,10)]    %>    <table>        %
        for row in rows:            ${makerow(row)}        % endfor    </table>    <%def

      Description: '=============================================MLflow: A Machine
        Learning Lifecycle Platform=============================================MLflow
        is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking
        experiments, packaging codeinto reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying
        models. MLflow offers a set of lightweight APIs that can beused with any existing
        machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc),
        wherever youcurrently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications
        or the cloud). MLflow''s current components are:* `MLflow Tracking <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_:
        An API to log parameters, code, and  results in machine learning experiments
        and compare them using an interactive UI.* `MLflow Projects <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html>`_:
        A code packaging format for reproducible  runs using Conda and Docker, so
        you can share your ML code with others.* `MLflow Models <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html>`_:
        A model packaging format and tools that let  you easily deploy the same model
        (from any ML library) to batch and real-time scoring on platforms such as  Docker,
        Apache Spark, Azure ML and AWS SageMaker.* `MLflow Model Registry <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html>`_:
        A centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage
        the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.|docs| |license| |downloads| |slack| |twitter|..

        https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/actions/workflows/push-images.yml?query=event%3AreleaseInstalling----------Install
        MLflow from PyPI via ``pip install mlflow``MLflow requires ``conda`` to be
        on the ``PATH`` for the projects feature.Nightly snapshots of MLflow master
        are also available `here <https://mlflow-snapshots.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/>`_.Install
        a lower dependency subset of MLflow from PyPI via ``pip install mlflow-skinny``Extra
        dependencies can be added per desired scenario.For example, ``pip install
        mlflow-skinny pandas numpy`` allows for mlflow.pyfunc.log_model support.Documentation-------------Official
        documentation for MLflow can be found at https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html.Roadmap-------The
        current MLflow Roadmap is available at https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/milestone/3.
        We areseeking contributions to all of our roadmap items with the ``help wanted``
        label. Please see the`Contributing`_ section for more information.Community---------For
        help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. "how do I do X?") see the `docs
        <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_or `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow>`_.To
        report a bug, file a documentation issue, or submit a feature request, please
        open a GitHub issue.For release announcements and other discussions, please
        subscribe to our mailing list (mlflow-users@googlegroups.com)or join us on
        `Slack`_.Running a Sample App With the Tracking API------------------------------------------The
        programs in ``examples`` use the MLflow Tracking API. For instance, run::    python
        examples/quickstart/mlflow_tracking.pyThis program will use `MLflow Tracking
        API <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_,which logs tracking data
        in ``./mlruns``. This can then be viewed with the Tracking UI.Launching the
        Tracking UI-------------------------The MLflow Tracking UI will show runs
        logged in ``./mlruns`` at `<http://localhost:5000>`_.Start it with::    mlflow
        ui**Note:** Running ``mlflow ui`` from within a clone of MLflow is not recommended
        - doing so willrun the dev UI from source. We recommend running the UI from
        a different working directory,specifying a backend store via the ``--backend-store-uri``
        option. Alternatively, seeinstructions for running the dev UI in the `contributor
        guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.Running a Project from a URI----------------------------The
        ``mlflow run`` command lets you run a project packaged with a MLproject file
        from a local pathor a Git URI::    mlflow run examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine
        -P alpha=0.4    mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P
        alpha=0.4See ``examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine`` for a sample project with
        an MLproject file.Saving and Serving Models-------------------------To illustrate
        managing models, the ``mlflow.sklearn`` package can log scikit-learn models
        asMLflow artifacts and then load them again for serving. There is an example
        training application in``examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py`` that
        you can run as follows::    $ python examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py    Score:
        0.666    Model saved in run <run-id>    $ mlflow models serve --model-uri
        runs:/<run-id>/model    $ curl -d ''{"dataframe_split": {"columns":[0],"index":[0,1],"data":[[1],[-1]]}}''
        -H ''Content-Type: application/json''  localhost:5000/invocations**Note:**
        If using MLflow skinny (``pip install mlflow-skinny``) for model serving,
        additionalrequired dependencies (namely, ``flask``) will need to be installed
        for the MLflow server to function.Official MLflow Docker Image----------------------------The
        official MLflow Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry at
        https://ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow... code-block:: shell    export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN    echo
        $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin    # Pull the
        latest version    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow    # Pull 2.2.1    docker
        pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:v2.2.1Contributing------------We happily welcome
        contributions to MLflow. We are also seeking contributions to items on the`MLflow
        Roadmap <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/milestone/3>`_. Please see our`contribution
        guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ to learn more about contributing to MLflow.Core
        Members------------MLflow is currently maintained by the following core members

        What is it?**pandas** is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and
        expressive datastructures designed to make working with \"relational\" or
        \"labeled\" data botheasy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level
        building block fordoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python.
        Additionally, it hasthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible
        open source dataanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**.
        It is already well onits way towards this goal.## Main FeaturesHere are just
        a few of the things that pandas does well:  - Easy handling of [**missing
        data**][missing-data] (represented as    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating
        point as well as non-floating point data  - Size mutability: columns can be
        [**inserted and    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher
        dimensional    objects  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]:
        objects can    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
        \   ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically    align
        the data for you in computations  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby]
        functionality to perform    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for
        both aggregating    and transforming data  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion]
        ragged,    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures
        \   into DataFrame objects  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing],
        [**fancy    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting]
        of    large data sets  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining]
        data    sets  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table]
        of    data sets  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have
        multiple    labels per tick)  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat
        files**][flat-files]    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],
        \   and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]
        \ - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range    generation
        and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,    date shifting and lagging

        OverviewThe Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your
        Python interpreter.This library provides extensive file format support, an
        efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.The
        core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic
        pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing
        tool.## More Information- [Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)  -

        Python library for Apache Arrow[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyarrow.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/)
        [![conda-forge](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/pyarrow.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyarrow)This
        library provides a Python API for functionality provided by the Arrow C++libraries,
        along with tools for Arrow integration and interoperability withpandas, NumPy,
        and other software in the Python ecosystem.## InstallingAcross platforms,
        you can install a recent version of pyarrow with the condapackage manager:```shellconda
        install pyarrow -c conda-forge```On Linux, macOS, and Windows, you can also
        install binary wheels from PyPI withpip:```shellpip install pyarrow```If you
        encounter any issues importing the pip wheels on Windows, you may needto install
        the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015][6].## DevelopmentSee
        [Python Development][2] in the documentation subproject.### Building the documentationSee

        Pydantic V1.10 vs. V2Pydantic V2 is a ground-up rewrite that offers many new
        features, performance improvements, and some breaking changes compared to
        Pydantic V1.If you're using Pydantic V1 you may want to look at the[pydantic
        V1.10 Documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or,[`1.10.X-fixes` git branch](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tree/1.10.X-fixes).
        Pydantic V2 also ships with the latest version of Pydantic V1 built in so
        that you can incrementally upgrade your code base and projects: `from pydantic
        import v1 as pydantic_v1`.## HelpSee [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
        for more details.## InstallationInstall using `pip install -U pydantic` or
        `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.For more installation options to make
        Pydantic even faster,see the [Install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/)
        section in the documentation.## A Simple Example```pyfrom datetime import
        datetimefrom typing import List, Optionalfrom pydantic import BaseModelclass
        User(BaseModel):    id: int    name: str = 'John Doe'    signup_ts: Optional[datetime]

      Description: 'PyParsing -- A Python Parsing Module====================================|Version|
        |Build Status| |Coverage| |License| |Python Versions| |Snyk Score|Introduction============The
        pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating andexecuting simple
        grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or theuse of regular expressions.
        The pyparsing module provides a library ofclasses that client code uses to
        construct the grammar directly inPython code.*[Since first writing this description
        of pyparsing in late 2003, thistechnique for developing parsers has become
        more widespread, under thename Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more
        information on PEGs*`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>`__*.]*Here
        is a program to parse ``"Hello, World!"`` (or any greeting of the form``"salutation,
        addressee!"``):.. code:: python    from pyparsing import Word, alphas    greet
        = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"    hello = "Hello, World!"    print(hello,
        "->", greet.parseString(hello))The program outputs the following::    Hello,
        World! -> [''Hello'', '','', ''World'', ''!'']The Python representation of
        the grammar is quite readable, owing to theself-explanatory class names, and
        the use of ''+'', ''|'' and ''^'' operatordefinitions.The parsed results returned
        from ``parseString()`` is a collection of type``ParseResults``, which can
        be accessed as anested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.The
        pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typicallyvexing when
        writing text parsers:- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will
        also handle ``"Hello,World!"``, ``"Hello , World !"``, etc.)- quoted strings-
        embedded commentsThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple
        CORBA IDLparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-function
        algebraic notation parser, among many others.Documentation=============There
        are many examples in the online docstrings of the classesand methods in pyparsing.
        You can find them compiled into `online docs <https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
        Additionaldocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online`GitHub

        Computing of relative deltas (next month, next year,  next Monday, last week
        of month, etc);* Computing of relative deltas between two given  date and/or
        datetime objects;* Computing of dates based on very flexible recurrence rules,
        \ using a superset of the `iCalendar <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt>`_
        \ specification. Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.* Generic parsing
        of dates in almost any string format;* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for
        tzfile(5) format  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ  environment
        string (in all known formats), iCalendar  format files, given ranges (with
        help from relative deltas),  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone,
        UTC timezone,  and Windows registry-based time zones.* Internal up-to-date
        world timezone information based on  Olson's database.* Computing of Easter
        Sunday dates for any given year,  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;*
        A comprehensive test suite.Quick example=============Here's a snapshot, just
        to give an idea about the power of thepackage. For more examples, look at
        the documentation.Suppose you want to know how much time is left, inyears/months/days/etc,
        before the next easter happening on ayear with a Friday 13th in August, and
        you want to get today'sdate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here
        is the code:.. code-block:: python3    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import
        *    >>> from dateutil.easter import *    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *

      Description: 'pytz - World Timezone Definitions for Python============================================:Author:
        Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>Introduction~~~~~~~~~~~~pytz brings
        the Olson tz database into Python. This library allowsaccurate and cross platform
        timezone calculations using Python 2.4or higher. It also solves the issue
        of ambiguous times at the endof daylight saving time, which you can read more
        about in the PythonLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).Almost all of the
        Olson timezones are supported... note::    Projects using Python 3.9 or later
        should be using the support    now included as part of the standard library,
        and third party    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.    pytz
        offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with    code written for
        earlier versions of Python... note::    This library differs from the documented
        Python API for    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock    times
        you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this    document.
        In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local    times that cross DST
        boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect    timezone (ie. subtract 1
        minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead
        of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A    ``normalize()`` method is provided
        to correct this. Unfortunately these    issues cannot be resolved without
        modifying the Python datetime    implementation (see PEP-431).Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~This
        package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using thestandard
        Python distutils.If you are installing using ``pip``, you don''t need to download
        anything as thelatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::    pip
        install pytzIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command
        as anadministrative user::    python setup.py installpytz for Enterprise~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Available
        as part of the Tidelift Subscription.The maintainers of pytz and thousands
        of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support
        and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.
        Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers
        of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.Example
        & Usage~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Localized times and date arithmetic----------------------------------->>>
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta>>> from pytz import timezone>>> import
        pytz>>> utc = pytz.utc>>> utc.zone''UTC''>>> eastern = timezone(''US/Eastern'')>>>
        eastern.zone''US/Eastern''>>> amsterdam = timezone(''Europe/Amsterdam'')>>>
        fmt = ''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z''This library only supports two ways of building
        a localized time. Thefirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by
        the pytz library.This is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with
        no timezoneinformation):>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27,
        6, 0, 0))>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500The second
        way of building a localized time is by converting an existinglocalized time
        using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)>>>
        ams_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100''Unfortunately using the
        tzinfo argument of the standard datetimeconstructors ''''does not work''''
        with pytz for many timezones.>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  #
        /!\ Does not work this way!''2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018''It is safe for
        timezones without daylight saving transitions though, suchas UTC:>>> datetime(2002,
        10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\ Not recommended except
        for UTC''2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000''The preferred way of dealing with times
        is to always work in UTC,converting to localtime only when generating output
        to be readby humans.>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)>>>
        loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:00:00
        EST-0500''This library also allows you to do date arithmetic using localtimes,
        although it is more complicated than working in UTC as youneed to use the
        ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving timeand other timezone transitions.
        In this example, ``loc_dt`` is setto the instant when daylight saving time
        ends in the US/Easterntimezone.>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)>>>
        before.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500''>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:50:00 EDT-0400''>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))>>>
        after.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500''Creating local times is
        also tricky, and the reason why working withlocal times is not recommended.
        Unfortunately, you cannot just passa ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing
        a datetime (see the nextsection for more details)>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10,
        27, 1, 30, 0)>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EDT-0400''>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EST-0500''Converting between timezones is more easily done, using
        thestandard astimezone method.>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899,
        tz=utc)>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> au_tz =
        timezone(''Australia/Sydney'')>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-27
        08:34:59 AEDT+1100''>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26
        21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2TrueYou can take shortcuts when dealing
        with the UTC side of timezoneconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()``
        are not reallynecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions
        todeal with.>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26
        21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> au_tz = timezone(''Australia/Sydney'')>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))>>>
        au_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100''>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)>>>
        utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000''``tzinfo`` API--------------The
        ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function havebeen extended
        to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``parameter to the ``utcoffset()``,
        ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.>>> tz = timezone(''America/St_Johns'')>>>
        normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)The
        ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only usedduring
        DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal,
        is_dst=True))-1 day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))1:00:00>>>
        tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)''NDT''>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))-1
        day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))1:00:00>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous,
        is_dst=True)''NDT''>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))-1 day, 21:30:00>>>
        tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds3600>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)''NDT''>>>
        print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))-1 day, 20:30:00>>> tz.dst(ambiguous,
        is_dst=False)datetime.timedelta(0)>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)''NST''If
        ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raisean ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError``
        exception.>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))-1 day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(normal))1:00:00>>>
        tz.tzname(normal)''NDT''>>> import pytz.exceptions>>> try:...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)...
        except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00>>>

        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00Problems
        with Localtime~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The major problem we have to deal with
        is that certain datetimesmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern
        timezoneon the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequencehappens:    -
        01:00 EDT occurs    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned
        back 1 hour      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)In fact, every
        instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This meansthat if you try and
        create a time in the ''US/Eastern'' timezonethe standard datetime syntax,
        there is no way to specify if you meantbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time
        transition. Using thepytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated
        guess:>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))>>>
        loc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500''As you can see, the system
        has chosen one for you and there is a 50%chance of it being out by one hour.
        For some applications, this doesnot matter. However, if you are trying to
        schedule meetings with peoplein different timezones or analyze log files it
        is not acceptable.The best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The
        pytzpackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation byincluding
        a special UTC implementation based on the standard Pythonreference implementation
        in the Python documentation.The UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance,
        and pickles to asmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementationcan
        be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone(''UTC'').>>> import pickle,
        pytz>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)>>>
        p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)17>>>
        new = pickle.loads(p)>>> new == dtTrue>>> new is dtFalse>>> new.tzinfo is
        dt.tzinfoTrue>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone(''UTC'')TrueNote that
        some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,Greenwich, Universal,
        etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from theseother timezones, and they
        are not equivalent. For this reason, they willnot compare the same in Python.>>>
        utc == pytz.timezone(''GMT'')FalseSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.If
        you insist on working with local times, this library provides afacility for
        constructing them unambiguously:>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30,
        00)>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt,
        is_dst=False)>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + '' / '' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500If you pass None as the is_dst
        flag to localize(), pytz will refuse toguess and raise exceptions if you try
        to build ambiguous or non-existenttimes.For example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002
        happened twice in the US/Easterntimezone when the clocks where put back at
        the end of Daylight SavingTime:>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)>>>
        try:...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % dt)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00Similarly,
        2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in theUS/Eastern timezone,
        as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skippingthe entire hour:>>> dt =
        datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)>>> try:...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)...
        except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:
        %s'' % dt)pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00Both of
        these exceptions share a common base class to make error handlingeasier:>>>
        isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)True>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(),
        pytz.InvalidTimeError)TrueA special case is where countries change their timezone
        definitionswith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsawswitched
        from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savingstransition.
        So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clockswere wound back
        24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannotbe specified without
        referring to the timezone abbreviation or theactual UTC offset. In this case
        midnight happened twice, neither timeduring a daylight saving time period.
        pytz handles this transition bytreating the ambiguous period before the switch
        as daylight savingstime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.>>>
        warsaw = pytz.timezone(''Europe/Warsaw'')>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915,
        8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:59:59
        WMT+0124''>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59),
        is_dst=False)>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100''>>>
        switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)>>>
        switch_dt.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100''>>> str(switch_dt -
        amb_dt1)''0:24:01''>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)''0:00:01''The best way of
        creating a time during an ambiguous time period isby converting from another
        timezone such as UTC:>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)>>>
        utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100''The
        standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not tohandle them,
        such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Easterntimezone definition
        from the Python documentation (Note that thisimplementation only works for
        dates between 1987 and 2006 - it isincluded for tests only!):>>> from pytz.reference
        import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10,
        27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)>>> str(dt)''2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00''>>> str(dt
        + timedelta(hours=1))''2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00''>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))''2002-10-27
        02:30:00-05:00''>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))''2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00''Notice
        the first two results? At first glance you might think they arecorrect, but
        taking the UTC offset into account you find that they areactually two hours
        appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.>>> from pytz.reference import UTC
        # pytz.reference only for tests>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))''2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00''>>>
        str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))''2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00''Country
        Information~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A mechanism is provided to access the timezones
        commonly in usefor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country
        code.It returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevanttzinfo
        instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:>>> print('' ''.join(pytz.country_timezones[''nz'']))Pacific/Auckland
        Pacific/ChathamThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English
        countryname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:>>> print(pytz.country_names[''nz''])New
        ZealandWhat is UTC~~~~~~~~~~~''UTC'' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It
        is a successor to, but distinctfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various
        definitions of UniversalTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating
        clocks and timemeasurement.All other timezones are defined relative to UTC,
        and include offsets likeUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive
        the local time. Nodaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone
        to performdate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities
        causedby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone,
        ormobile computers that roam through multiple timezones...  _Coordinated Universal
        Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_TimeHelpers~~~~~~~There
        are two lists of timezones provided.``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list
        of the timezone names that canbe used.>>> from pytz import all_timezones>>>
        len(all_timezones) >= 500True>>> ''Etc/Greenwich'' in all_timezonesTrue``common_timezones``
        is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn''tcontain deprecated zones
        or historical zones, except for a few I''vedeemed in common usage, such as
        US/Eastern (open a bug report if youthink other timezones are deserving of
        being included here). It is alsoa sequence of strings.>>> from pytz import
        common_timezones>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)True>>> ''Etc/Greenwich''
        in common_timezonesFalse>>> ''Australia/Melbourne'' in common_timezonesTrue>>>
        ''US/Eastern'' in common_timezonesTrue>>> ''Canada/Eastern'' in common_timezonesTrue>>>
        ''Australia/Yancowinna'' in all_timezonesTrue>>> ''Australia/Yancowinna''
        in common_timezonesFalseBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are
        alphabeticallysorted:>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()>>>
        common_timezones == common_timezones_dupeTrue>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]>>>
        all_timezones_dupe.sort()>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupeTrue``all_timezones``
        and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set,
        common_timezones_set>>> ''US/Eastern'' in all_timezones_setTrue>>> ''US/Eastern''
        in common_timezones_setTrue>>> ''Australia/Victoria'' in common_timezones_setFalseYou
        can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countriesusing the
        ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166two letter country
        code.>>> from pytz import country_timezones>>> print('' ''.join(country_timezones(''ch'')))Europe/Zurich>>>
        print('' ''.join(country_timezones(''CH'')))Europe/ZurichInternationalization
        - i18n/l10n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pytz is an interface to the IANA
        database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium''s Unicode Locales
        (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_project provides translations. Python packages
        such as`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_and
        Thomas Khyn''s `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be usedto
        access these translations from Python.License~~~~~~~MIT license.This code
        is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope PublicLicense,  Version
        2.1 (ZPL).I''m happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in
        otheropen source projects.Latest Versions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This package will
        be updated after releases of the Olson timezonedatabase.  The latest version
        can be downloaded from the `Python PackageIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The
        code that is usedto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and availableusing
        git::    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.gitAnnouncements of new
        releases are made on`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the`Atom
        feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_hosted there.Bugs,
        Feature Requests & Patches~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bugs should be reported
        on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.Feature requests are
        unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directedto timezone support
        now built into Python or packages that work with it.Security Issues~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Reports
        about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.Issues
        & Limitations~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects
        using Python 3.9 or later  are best served by using the timezone functionaly
        now included in core  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata
        <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the
        nearest whole minute, so timezones  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will
        be up to 30 seconds out. This  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.-
        If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can''t fix  it.
        pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and  changes
        to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.  If you find errors
        they should be reported to the time zone mailing  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.Further

        is the readme for the Python for Win32 (pywin32) extensions, which provides
        access to many of the Windows APIs from Python.See [CHANGES.txt](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/blob/master/CHANGES.txt)
        for recent notable changes.Only Python 3 is supported. If you want Python
        2 support, you want build `228`.## DocsThe docs are a long and sad story,
        but [there''s now an online version](https://mhammond.github.io/pywin32/)of
        the helpfile that ships with the installers (thanks [@ofek](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/pull/1774)!).Lots
        of that is very old, but some is auto-generated and current. Would love help
        untangling the docs!## SupportFeel free to [open issues](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/issues)
        forall bugs (or suspected bugs) in pywin32. [pull-requests](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/pulls)for
        all bugs or features are also welcome.However, please **do not open github
        issues for general support requests**, orfor problems or questions using the
        modules in this package - they will beclosed. For such issues, please email
        the[python-win32 mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-win32)
        -note that you must be subscribed to the list before posting.## Binaries[Binary
        releases are deprecated.](https://mhammond.github.io/pywin32_installers.html)While
        they are still provided, [find them here](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases)##
        Installing via PIPYou should install pywin32 via pip - eg,> python -m pip
        install --upgrade pywin32If you encounter any problems when upgrading (eg,
        "module not found" errors or similar), youshould execute:> python Scripts/pywin32_postinstall.py
        -installThis will make some small attempts to cleanup older conflicting installs.Note
        that if you want to use pywin32 for "system wide" features, such asregistering
        COM objects or implementing Windows Services, then you must runthat command
        from an elevated (ie, "Run as Administrator) command prompt.For unreleased
        changes, you can download builds made by [github actions](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/actions/)
        -choose any "workflow" from the `main` branch and download its "artifacts")###
        `The specified procedure could not be found` / `Entry-point not found` Errors?A
        very common report is that people install pywin32, but many imports fail with
        errorssimilar to the above.In almost all cases, this tends to mean there are
        other pywin32 DLLs installed in your system,but in a different location than
        the new ones. This sometimes happens in environments thatcome with pywin32
        pre-shipped (eg, anaconda?).The possible solutions are:* Run the "post_install"
        script documented above.* Otherwise, find and remove all other copies of `pywintypesXX.dll`
        and `pythoncomXX.dll`  (where `XX` is the Python version - eg, "39")### Running
        as a Windows ServiceModern Python installers do not, by default, install Python
        in a way that is suitable forrunning as a service, particularly for other
        users.* Ensure Python is installed in a location where the user running the
        service has  access to the installation and is able to load `pywintypesXX.dll`
        and `pythonXX.dll`.* Manually copy `pythonservice.exe` from the `site-packages/win32`
        directory to  the same place as these DLLs.## Building from sourceInstall
        Visual Studio 2019 (later probably works, but options might be different),select
        "Desktop Development with C++", then the following options:* Windows 10 SDK
        (latest offered I guess? At time of writing, 10.0.18362)* "C++ for MFC for
        ..."* ARM build tools if necessary.(the free compilers probably work too,
        but haven''t been tested - let me know your experiences!)`setup.py` is a standard
        distutils build script, so you probably want:> python setup.py installor>
        python setup.py --helpSome modules need obscure SDKs to build - `setup.py`
        should succeed, gracefullytelling you why it failed to build them - if the
        build actually fails with yourconfiguration, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/issues).##
        Release processThe following steps are performed when making a new release
        - this is mainlyto form a checklist so mhammond doesn''t forget what to do
        :)* Ensure CHANGES.txt has everything worth noting, commit it.* Update setup.py
        with the new build number.* Execute build.bat, wait forever, test the artifacts.*
        Upload .whl artifacts to pypi - we do this before pushing the tag because
        they might be  rejected for an invalid `README.md`. Done via `py -3.? -m twine
        upload dist/*XXX*.whl`.* Commit setup.py (so the new build number is in the
        repo), create a new git tag* Upload the .exe installers to github.* Update
        setup.py with the new build number + ".1" (eg, 123.1), to ensure  future test
        builds aren''t mistaken for the real release.* Make sure everything is pushed
        to github, including the tag (ie,  `git push --tags`)* Send mail to python-win32'

      Description: "# Requests**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.```python>>>
        import requests>>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass',
        auth=('user', 'pass'))>>> r.status_code200>>> r.headers['content-type']'application/json;
        charset=utf8'>>> r.encoding'utf-8'>>> r.text'{\"authenticated\": true, ...'>>>
        r.json(){'authenticated': True, ...}```Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1
        requests extremely easily. There\u2019s no need to manually add query strings
        to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data \u2014 but nowadays,
        just use the `json` method!Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages
        today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`\u2014 according to GitHub,
        Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D)
        by `1,000,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests)[![Supported

        Cloning the repositoryWhen cloning the Requests repository, you may need to
        add the `-cfetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad
        commit (see[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more
        background):```shellgit clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git```You
        can also apply this setting to your global Git config:```shellgit config --global
        fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore```---[![Kenneth Reitz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/kr.png)](https://kennethreitz.org)

      Description: '## MotivationWhen reading from many possibly large files in a
        fashion similar to random access, it is usually the fastest and most efficient
        to use memory maps.Although memory maps have many advantages, they represent
        a very limited system resource as every map uses one file descriptor, whose
        amount is limited per process. On 32 bit systems, the amount of memory you
        can have mapped at a time is naturally limited to theoretical 4GB of memory,
        which may not be enough for some applications.## Limitations* **System resources
        (file-handles) are likely to be leaked!** This is due to the library authors
        reliance on a deterministic `__del__()` destructor.* The memory access is
        read-only by design.## Overview![Python package](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)Smmap
        wraps an interface around mmap and tracks the mapped files as well as the
        amount of clients who use it. If the system runs out of resources, or if a
        memory limit is reached, it will automatically unload unused maps to allow
        continued operation.To allow processing large files even on 32 bit systems,
        it allows only portions of the file to be mapped. Once the user reads beyond
        the mapped region, smmap will automatically map the next required region,
        unloading unused regions using a LRU algorithm.Although the library can be
        used most efficiently with its native interface, a Buffer implementation is
        provided to hide these details behind a simple string-like interface.For performance
        critical 64 bit applications, a simplified version of memory mapping is provided
        which always maps the whole file, but still provides the benefit of unloading
        unused mappings on demand.## Prerequisites* Python 3.7+* OSX, Windows or LinuxThe
        package was tested on all of the previously mentioned configurations.## Installing
        smmap[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/smmap/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/smmap/?badge=latest)Its
        easiest to install smmap using the [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest)
        program:```bash$ pip install smmap```As the command will install smmap in
        your respective python distribution, you will most likely need root permissions
        to authorize the required changes.If you have downloaded the source archive,
        the package can be installed by running the `setup.py` script:```bash$ python
        setup.py install```It is advised to have a look at the **Usage Guide** for
        a brief introduction on the different database implementations.## Homepage

        PyPI - DownloadsThe Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational MapperIntroduction-------------SQLAlchemy
        is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapperthat gives application
        developers the full power andflexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full
        suiteof well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,designed for efficient
        and high-performing databaseaccess, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domainlanguage.Major
        SQLAlchemy features include:* An industrial strength ORM, built  from the
        core on the identity map, unit of work,  and data mapper patterns.   These
        patterns  allow transparent persistence of objects  using a declarative configuration
        system.  Domain models  can be constructed and manipulated naturally,  and
        changes are synchronized with the  current transaction automatically.* A relationally-oriented
        query system, exposing  the full range of SQL''s capabilities  explicitly,
        including joins, subqueries,  correlation, and most everything else,  in terms
        of the object model.  Writing queries with the ORM uses the same  techniques
        of relational composition you use  when writing SQL.  While you can drop into  literal
        SQL at any time, it''s virtually never  needed.* A comprehensive and flexible
        system  of eager loading for related collections and objects.  Collections
        are cached within a session,  and can be loaded on individual access, all  at
        once using joins, or by query per collection  across the full result set.*
        A Core SQL construction system and DBAPI  interaction layer.  The SQLAlchemy
        Core is  separate from the ORM and is a full database  abstraction layer in
        its own right, and includes  an extensible Python-based SQL expression  language,
        schema metadata, connection pooling,  type coercion, and custom types.* All
        primary and foreign key constraints are  assumed to be composite and natural.  Surrogate  integer
        primary keys are of course still the  norm, but SQLAlchemy never assumes or
        hardcodes  to this model.* Database introspection and generation.  Database  schemas
        can be "reflected" in one step into  Python structures representing database
        metadata;  those same structures can then generate  CREATE statements right
        back out - all within  the Core, independent of the ORM.SQLAlchemy''s philosophy:*
        SQL databases behave less and less like object  collections the more size
        and performance start to  matter; object collections behave less and less
        like  tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.  SQLAlchemy aims
        to accommodate both of these  principles.* An ORM doesn''t need to hide the
        "R".   A relational  database provides rich, set-based functionality  that
        should be fully exposed.   SQLAlchemy''s  ORM provides an open-ended set of
        patterns  that allow a developer to construct a custom  mediation layer between
        a domain model and  a relational schema, turning the so-called  "object relational
        impedance" issue into  a distant memory.* The developer, in all cases, makes
        all decisions  regarding the design, structure, and naming conventions  of
        both the object model as well as the relational  schema.   SQLAlchemy only
        provides the means  to automate the execution of these decisions.* With SQLAlchemy,
        there''s no such thing as  "the ORM generated a bad query" - you  retain full
        control over the structure of  queries, including how joins are organized,  how
        subqueries and correlation is used, what  columns are requested.  Everything
        SQLAlchemy  does is ultimately the result of a developer-initiated   decision.*
        Don''t use an ORM if the problem doesn''t need one.  SQLAlchemy consists of
        a Core and separate ORM  component.   The Core offers a full SQL expression  language
        that allows Pythonic construction  of SQL constructs that render directly
        to SQL  strings for a target database, returning  result sets that are essentially
        enhanced DBAPI  cursors.* Transactions should be the norm.  With SQLAlchemy''s  ORM,
        nothing goes to permanent storage until  commit() is called.  SQLAlchemy encourages
        applications  to create a consistent means of delineating  the start and end
        of a series of operations.* Never render a literal value in a SQL statement.  Bound
        parameters are used to the greatest degree  possible, allowing query optimizers
        to cache  query plans effectively and making SQL injection  attacks a non-issue.Documentation-------------Latest

        helpers to limit the number of threads used in thethreadpool-backed of common
        native libraries used for scientificcomputing and data science (e.g. BLAS
        and OpenMP).Fine control of the underlying thread-pool size can be useful
        inworkloads that involve nested parallelism so as to mitigateoversubscription
        issues.## Installation- For users, install the last published version from
        PyPI:  ```bash  pip install threadpoolctl  ```- For contributors, install
        from the source repository in developer  mode:  ```bash  pip install -r dev-requirements.txt  flit
        install --symlink  ```  then you run the tests with pytest:  ```bash  pytest  ```##
        Usage### Command Line InterfaceGet a JSON description of thread-pools initialized
        when importing pythonpackages such as numpy or scipy for instance:```python
        -m threadpoolctl -i numpy scipy.linalg[  {    "filepath": "/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so",    "prefix":
        "libmkl_rt",    "user_api": "blas",    "internal_api": "mkl",    "version":
        "2019.0.4",    "num_threads": 2,    "threading_layer": "intel"  },  {    "filepath":
        "/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so",    "prefix": "libiomp",    "user_api":
        "openmp",    "internal_api": "openmp",    "version": null,    "num_threads":
        4  }]```The JSON information is written on STDOUT. If some of the packages
        are missing,a warning message is displayed on STDERR.### Python Runtime Programmatic
        IntrospectionIntrospect the current state of the threadpool-enabled runtime
        librariesthat are loaded when importing Python packages:```python>>> from
        threadpoolctl import threadpool_info>>> from pprint import pprint>>> pprint(threadpool_info())[]>>>
        import numpy>>> pprint(threadpool_info())[{''filepath'': ''/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so'',  ''internal_api'':
        ''mkl'',  ''num_threads'': 2,  ''prefix'': ''libmkl_rt'',  ''threading_layer'':
        ''intel'',  ''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''version'': ''2019.0.4''}, {''filepath'':
        ''/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so'',  ''internal_api'':
        ''openmp'',  ''num_threads'': 4,  ''prefix'': ''libiomp'',  ''user_api'':
        ''openmp'',  ''version'': None}]>>> import xgboost>>> pprint(threadpool_info())[{''filepath'':
        ''/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so'',  ''internal_api'':
        ''mkl'',  ''num_threads'': 2,  ''prefix'': ''libmkl_rt'',  ''threading_layer'':
        ''intel'',  ''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''version'': ''2019.0.4''}, {''filepath'':
        ''/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so'',  ''internal_api'':
        ''openmp'',  ''num_threads'': 4,  ''prefix'': ''libiomp'',  ''user_api'':
        ''openmp'',  ''version'': None}, {''filepath'': ''/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libgomp.so.1.0.0'',  ''internal_api'':
        ''openmp'',  ''num_threads'': 4,  ''prefix'': ''libgomp'',  ''user_api'':
        ''openmp'',  ''version'': None}]```In the above example, `numpy` was installed
        from the default anaconda channel and comeswith MKL and its Intel OpenMP (`libiomp5`)
        implementation while `xgboost` was installedfrom pypi.org and links against
        GNU OpenMP (`libgomp`) so both OpenMP runtimes areloaded in the same Python
        program.The state of these libraries is also accessible through the object
        oriented API:```python>>> from threadpoolctl import ThreadpoolController,
        threadpool_info>>> from pprint import pprint>>> import numpy>>> controller
        = ThreadpoolController()>>> pprint(controller.info())[{''architecture'': ''Haswell'',  ''filepath'':
        ''/home/jeremie/miniconda/envs/dev/lib/libopenblasp-r0.3.17.so'',  ''internal_api'':
        ''openblas'',  ''num_threads'': 4,  ''prefix'': ''libopenblas'',  ''threading_layer'':
        ''pthreads'',  ''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''version'': ''0.3.17''}]>>> controller.info()
        == threadpool_info()True```### Setting the Maximum Size of Thread-PoolsControl
        the number of threads used by the underlying runtime librariesin specific
        sections of your Python program:```python>>> from threadpoolctl import threadpool_limits>>>
        import numpy as np>>> with threadpool_limits(limits=1, user_api=''blas''):...     #
        In this block, calls to blas implementation (like openblas or MKL)...     #
        will be limited to use only one thread. They can thus be used jointly...     #
        with thread-parallelism....     a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)...     a_squared
        = a @ a```The threadpools can also be controlled via the object oriented API,
        which is especiallyuseful to avoid searching through all the loaded shared
        libraries each time. It willhowever not act on libraries loaded after the
        instantiation of the`ThreadpoolController`:```python>>> from threadpoolctl
        import ThreadpoolController>>> import numpy as np>>> controller = ThreadpoolController()>>>
        with controller.limit(limits=1, user_api=''blas''):...     a = np.random.randn(1000,
        1000)...     a_squared = a @ a```### Restricting the limits to the scope of
        a function`threadpool_limits` and `ThreadpoolController` can also be used
        as decorators to setthe maximum number of threads used by the supported libraries
        at a function level. Thedecorators are accessible through their `wrap` method:```python>>>
        from threadpoolctl import ThreadpoolController, threadpool_limits>>> import
        numpy as np>>> controller = ThreadpoolController()>>> @controller.wrap(limits=1,
        user_api=''blas'')... # or @threadpool_limits.wrap(limits=1, user_api=''blas'')...
        def my_func():...     # Inside this function, calls to blas implementation
        (like openblas or MKL)...     # will be limited to use only one thread....     a
        = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)...     a_squared = a @ a...```### Switching
        the FlexiBLAS backend`FlexiBLAS` is a BLAS wrapper for which the BLAS backend
        can be switched at runtime.`threadpoolctl` exposes python bindings for this
        feature. Here''s an example but notethat this part of the API is experimental
        and subject to change without deprecation:```python>>> from threadpoolctl
        import ThreadpoolController>>> import numpy as np>>> controller = ThreadpoolController()>>>
        controller.info()[{''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''internal_api'': ''flexiblas'',  ''num_threads'':
        1,  ''prefix'': ''libflexiblas'',  ''filepath'': ''/usr/local/lib/libflexiblas.so.3.3'',  ''version'':
        ''3.3.1'',  ''available_backends'': [''NETLIB'', ''OPENBLASPTHREAD'', ''ATLAS''],  ''loaded_backends'':
        [''NETLIB''],  ''current_backend'': ''NETLIB''}]# Retrieve the flexiblas controller>>>
        flexiblas_ct = controller.select(internal_api="flexiblas").lib_controllers[0]#
        Switch the backend with one predefined at build time (listed in "available_backends")>>>
        flexiblas_ct.switch_backend("OPENBLASPTHREAD")>>> controller.info()[{''user_api'':
        ''blas'',  ''internal_api'': ''flexiblas'',  ''num_threads'': 4,  ''prefix'':
        ''libflexiblas'',  ''filepath'': ''/usr/local/lib/libflexiblas.so.3.3'',  ''version'':
        ''3.3.1'',  ''available_backends'': [''NETLIB'', ''OPENBLASPTHREAD'', ''ATLAS''],  ''loaded_backends'':
        [''NETLIB'', ''OPENBLASPTHREAD''],  ''current_backend'': ''OPENBLASPTHREAD''},
        {''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''internal_api'': ''openblas'',  ''num_threads'':
        4,  ''prefix'': ''libopenblas'',  ''filepath'': ''/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so'',  ''version'':
        ''0.3.8'',  ''threading_layer'': ''pthreads'',  ''architecture'': ''Haswell''}]#
        It''s also possible to directly give the path to a shared library>>> flexiblas_controller.switch_backend("/home/jeremie/miniforge/envs/flexiblas_threadpoolctl/lib/libmkl_rt.so")>>>
        controller.info()[{''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''internal_api'': ''flexiblas'',  ''num_threads'':
        2,  ''prefix'': ''libflexiblas'',  ''filepath'': ''/usr/local/lib/libflexiblas.so.3.3'',  ''version'':
        ''3.3.1'',  ''available_backends'': [''NETLIB'', ''OPENBLASPTHREAD'', ''ATLAS''],  ''loaded_backends'':
        [''NETLIB'',   ''OPENBLASPTHREAD'',   ''/home/jeremie/miniforge/envs/flexiblas_threadpoolctl/lib/libmkl_rt.so''],  ''current_backend'':
        ''/home/jeremie/miniforge/envs/flexiblas_threadpoolctl/lib/libmkl_rt.so''},
        {''user_api'': ''openmp'',  ''internal_api'': ''openmp'',  ''num_threads'':
        4,  ''prefix'': ''libomp'',  ''filepath'': ''/home/jeremie/miniforge/envs/flexiblas_threadpoolctl/lib/libomp.so'',  ''version'':
        None}, {''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''internal_api'': ''openblas'',  ''num_threads'':
        4,  ''prefix'': ''libopenblas'',  ''filepath'': ''/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so'',  ''version'':
        ''0.3.8'',  ''threading_layer'': ''pthreads'',  ''architecture'': ''Haswell''},
        {''user_api'': ''blas'',  ''internal_api'': ''mkl'',  ''num_threads'': 2,  ''prefix'':
        ''libmkl_rt'',  ''filepath'': ''/home/jeremie/miniforge/envs/flexiblas_threadpoolctl/lib/libmkl_rt.so.2'',  ''version'':
        ''2024.0-Product'',  ''threading_layer'': ''gnu''}]```You can observe that
        the previously linked OpenBLAS shared object stays loaded bythe Python program
        indefinitely, but FlexiBLAS itself no longer delegates BLAS callsto OpenBLAS
        as indicated by the `current_backend` attribute.### Writing a custom library
        controllerCurrently, `threadpoolctl` has support for `OpenMP` and the main
        `BLAS` libraries.However it can also be used to control the threadpool of
        other native libraries,provided that they expose an API to get and set the
        limit on the number of threads.For that, one must implement a controller for
        this library and register it to`threadpoolctl`.A custom controller must be
        a subclass of the `LibController` class and implementthe attributes and methods
        described in the docstring of `LibController`. Then thisnew controller class
        must be registered using the `threadpoolctl.register` function.An complete
        example can be found [here](  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/tests/_pyMylib/__init__.py).###
        Sequential BLAS within OpenMP parallel regionWhen one wants to have sequential
        BLAS calls within an OpenMP parallel region, it''ssafer to set `limits="sequential_blas_under_openmp"`
        since setting `limits=1` and`user_api="blas"` might not lead to the expected
        behavior in some configurations(e.g. OpenBLAS with the OpenMP threading layerhttps://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2985).###
        Known Limitations- `threadpool_limits` can fail to limit the number of inner
        threads when nesting  parallel loops managed by distinct OpenMP runtime implementations
        (for instance  libgomp from GCC and libomp from clang/llvm or libiomp from
        ICC).  See the `test_openmp_nesting` function in [tests/test_threadpoolctl.py](  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/tests/test_threadpoolctl.py)  for
        an example. More information can be found at:  https://github.com/jeremiedbb/Nested_OpenMP  Note
        however that this problem does not happen when `threadpool_limits` is  used
        to limit the number of threads used internally by BLAS calls that are  themselves
        nested under OpenMP parallel loops. `threadpool_limits` works as  expected,
        even if the inner BLAS implementation relies on a distinct OpenMP  implementation.-
        Using Intel OpenMP (ICC) and LLVM OpenMP (clang) in the same Python program  under
        Linux is known to cause problems. See the following guide for more details  and
        workarounds:  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/multiple_openmp.md-
        Setting the maximum number of threads of the OpenMP and BLAS libraries has
        a global  effect and impacts the whole Python process. There is no thread
        level isolation as  these libraries do not offer thread-local APIs to configure
        the number of threads to  use in nested parallel calls.## MaintainersTo make
        a release:Bump the version number (`__version__`) in `threadpoolctl.py`.Build
        the distribution archives:```bashpip install flitflit build```Check the contents
        of `dist/`.If everything is fine, make a commit for the release, tag it, push
        thetag to github and then:```bashflit publish```### CreditsThe initial dynamic
        library introspection code was written by @anton-malakhovfor the smp package
        available at https://github.com/IntelPython/smp .threadpoolctl extends this
        for other operating systems. Contrary to smp,threadpoolctl does not attempt
        to limit the size of Python multiprocessingpools (threads or processes) or
        set operating system-level CPU affinityconstraints: threadpoolctl only interacts
        with native libraries via theirpublic runtime APIs.'

        of thePython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.urllib3 brings
        many critical features that are missing from the Pythonstandard libraries:-
        Thread safety.- Connection pooling.- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.- File
        uploads with multipart encoding.- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing
        with HTTP redirects.- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.-
        Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.- 100% test coverage.urllib3 is powerful
        and easy to use:```python3>>> import urllib3>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\",
        \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")>>> resp.status200>>> resp.datab\"User-agent:
        *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"```## Installingurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):```bash$
        python -m pip install urllib3```Alternatively, you can grab the latest source
        code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):```bash$ git clone
        https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git$ cd urllib3$ pip install .```## Documentationurllib3

        is a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptableperformance.
        It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Pythonstandard library.
        It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 3.7+. Itis also known
        to run on PyPy 3 (version 3.7 compatible python) on UNIX. Itsupports HTTP/1.0
        and HTTP/1.1.For more information, see the "docs" directory of the Waitress
        package or visithttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/2.1.2-----Bugfix~~~~~~-
        When expose_tracebacks is enabled waitress would fail to properly encode  unicode
        thereby causing another error during error handling. See  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/378-
        Header length checking had a calculation that was done incorrectly when the  data
        was received across multple socket reads. This calculation has been  corrected,
        and no longer will Waitress send back a 413 Request Entity Too  Large. See
        https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/376Security Bugfix~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-
        in 2.1.0 a new feature was introduced that allowed the WSGI thread to start  sending
        data to the socket. However this introduced a race condition whereby  a socket
        may be closed in the sending thread while the main thread is about  to call
        select() therey causing the entire application to be taken down.  Waitress
        will no longer close the socket in the WSGI thread, instead waking  up the
        main thread to cleanup. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/3772.1.1-----Security
        Bugfix~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Waitress now validates that chunked encoding extensions
        are valid, and don''t  contain invalid characters that are not allowed. They
        are still skipped/not  processed, but if they contain invalid data we no longer
        continue in and  return a 400 Bad Request. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP
        request  smuggling. Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36-
        Waitress now validates that the chunk length is only valid hex digits when  parsing
        chunked encoding, and values such as ``0x01`` and ``+01`` are no  longer supported.
        This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling.  Thanks to Zhang
        Zeyu for reporting this issue. See  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36-
        Waitress now validates that the Content-Length sent by a remote contains only  digits
        in accordance with RFC7230 and will return a 400 Bad Request when the  Content-Length
        header contains invalid data, such as ``+10`` which would  previously get
        parsed as ``10`` and accepted. This stops potential HTTP  desync/HTTP request
        smuggling Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c362.1.0-----Python
        Version Support~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Python 3.6 is no longer supported by
        Waitress- Python 3.10 is fully supported by WaitressBugfix~~~~~~- ``wsgi.file_wrapper``
        now sets the ``seekable``, ``seek``, and ``tell``  attributes from the underlying
        file if the underlying file is seekable. This  allows WSGI middleware to implement
        things like range requests for example  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/359
        and  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/363- In Python 3 ``OSError``
        is no longer subscriptable, this caused failures on  Windows attempting to
        loop to find an socket that would work for use in the  trigger.  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/361-
        Fixed an issue whereby ``BytesIO`` objects were not properly closed, and  thereby
        would not get cleaned up until garbage collection would get around to  it.  This
        led to potential for random memory spikes/memory issues, see  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/358
        and  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/357 .  With thanks to Florian
        Schulze for testing/vaidating this fix!Features~~~~~~~~- When the WSGI app
        starts sending data to the output buffer, we now attempt to  send data directly
        to the socket. This avoids needing to wake up the main  thread to start sending
        data. Allowing faster transmission of the first byte.  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/364  With
        thanks to Michael Merickel for being a great rubber ducky!- Add REQUEST_URI
        to the WSGI environment.  REQUEST_URI is similar to ``request_uri`` in nginx.
        It is a string that  contains the request path before separating the query
        string and  decoding ``%``-escaped characters. '

        ("work"), *zeug* ("stuff")Werkzeug is a comprehensive `WSGI`_ web application
        library. It began asa simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications
        and hasbecome one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.It includes:-   An
        interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and    source code
        in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any    frame in the stack.-   A
        full-featured request object with objects to interact with    headers, query
        args, form data, files, and cookies.-   A response object that can wrap other
        WSGI applications and handle    streaming data.-   A routing system for matching
        URLs to endpoints and generating URLs    for endpoints, with an extensible
        system for capturing variables    from URLs.-   HTTP utilities to handle entity
        tags, cache control, dates, user    agents, cookies, files, and more.-   A
        threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications    locally.-   A
        test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without    requiring
        running a server.Werkzeug doesn''t enforce any dependencies. It is up to the
        developer tochoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handlerequests.
        It can be used to build all sorts of end user applicationssuch as blogs, wikis,
