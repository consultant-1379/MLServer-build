        Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/aiofiles.svg)](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles)[![Black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)**aiofiles**
        is an Apache2 licensed library, written in Python, for handling localdisk
        files in asyncio applications.Ordinary local file IO is blocking, and cannot
        easily and portably be madeasynchronous. This means doing file IO may interfere
        with asyncio applications,which shouldn''t block the executing thread. aiofiles
        helps with this byintroducing asynchronous versions of files that support
        delegating operations toa separate thread pool.```pythonasync with aiofiles.open(''filename'',
        mode=''r'') as f:    contents = await f.read()print(contents)''My file contents''```Asynchronous
        iteration is also supported.```pythonasync with aiofiles.open(''filename'')
        as f:    async for line in f:        ...```Asynchronous interface to tempfile
        module.```pythonasync with aiofiles.tempfile.TemporaryFile(''wb'') as f:    await
        f.write(b''Hello, World!'')```## Features- a file API very similar to Python''s
        standard, blocking API- support for buffered and unbuffered binary files,
        and buffered text files- support for `async`/`await` ([PEP 492](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/))
        constructs- async interface to tempfile module## InstallationTo install aiofiles,
        simply:```bash$ pip install aiofiles```## UsageFiles are opened using the
        `aiofiles.open()` coroutine, which in addition tomirroring the builtin `open`
        accepts optional `loop` and `executor`arguments. If `loop` is absent, the
        default loop will be used, as per theset asyncio policy. If `executor` is
        not specified, the default event loopexecutor will be used.In case of success,
        an asynchronous file object is returned with anAPI identical to an ordinary
        file, except the following methods are coroutinesand delegate to an executor:-
        `close`- `flush`- `isatty`- `read`- `readall`- `read1`- `readinto`- `readline`-
        `readlines`- `seek`- `seekable`- `tell`- `truncate`- `writable`- `write`-
        `writelines`In case of failure, one of the usual exceptions will be raised.`aiofiles.stdin`,
        `aiofiles.stdout`, `aiofiles.stderr`,`aiofiles.stdin_bytes`, `aiofiles.stdout_bytes`,
        and`aiofiles.stderr_bytes` provide async access to `sys.stdin`,`sys.stdout`,
        `sys.stderr`, and their corresponding `.buffer` properties.The `aiofiles.os`
        module contains executor-enabled coroutine versions ofseveral useful `os`
        functions that deal with files:- `stat`- `statvfs`- `sendfile`- `rename`-
        `renames`- `replace`- `remove`- `unlink`- `mkdir`- `makedirs`- `rmdir`- `removedirs`-
        `link`- `symlink`- `readlink`- `listdir`- `scandir`- `access`- `path.exists`-
        `path.isfile`- `path.isdir`- `path.islink`- `path.ismount`- `path.getsize`-
        `path.getatime`- `path.getctime`- `path.samefile`- `path.sameopenfile`###
        Tempfile**aiofiles.tempfile** implements the following interfaces:- TemporaryFile-
        NamedTemporaryFile- SpooledTemporaryFile- TemporaryDirectoryResults return
        wrapped with a context manager allowing use with async with and async for.```pythonasync
        with aiofiles.tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(''wb+'') as f:    await f.write(b''Line1\n
        Line2'')    await f.seek(0)    async for line in f:        print(line)async
        with aiofiles.tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:    filename = os.path.join(d,
        "file.ext")```### Writing tests for aiofilesReal file IO can be mocked by
        patching `aiofiles.threadpool.sync_open`as desired. The return type also needs
        to be registered with the`aiofiles.threadpool.wrap` dispatcher:```pythonaiofiles.threadpool.wrap.register(mock.MagicMock)(    lambda
        *args, **kwargs: threadpool.AsyncBufferedIOBase(*args, **kwargs))async def
        test_stuff():    data = ''data''    mock_file = mock.MagicMock()    with mock.patch(''aiofiles.threadpool.sync_open'',
        return_value=mock_file) as mock_open:        async with aiofiles.open(''filename'',
        ''w'') as f:            await f.write(data)        mock_file.write.assert_called_once_with(data)```###

        is a high-level, asynchronous message producer.Example of AIOKafkaProducer
        usage:.. code-block:: python    from aiokafka import AIOKafkaProducer    import
        asyncio    async def send_one():        producer = AIOKafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers=''localhost:9092'')        #
        Get cluster layout and initial topic/partition leadership information        await

        producer.send_and_wait("my_topic", b"Super message")        finally:            #
        Wait for all pending messages to be delivered or expire.            await
        producer.stop()    asyncio.run(send_one())AIOKafkaConsumer****************AIOKafkaConsumer
        is a high-level, asynchronous message consumer.It interacts with the assigned
        Kafka Group Coordinator node to allow multipleconsumers to load balance consumption
        of topics (requires kafka >= 0.9.0.0).Example of AIOKafkaConsumer usage:..
        code-block:: python    from aiokafka import AIOKafkaConsumer    import asyncio    async
        def consume():        consumer = AIOKafkaConsumer(            ''my_topic'',
        ''my_other_topic'',            bootstrap_servers=''localhost:9092'',            group_id="my-group")        #
        Get cluster layout and join group `my-group`        await consumer.start()        try:            #
        Consume messages            async for msg in consumer:                print("consumed:
        ", msg.topic, msg.partition, msg.offset,                      msg.key, msg.value,
        msg.timestamp)        finally:            # Will leave consumer group; perform
        autocommit if enabled.            await consumer.stop()    asyncio.run(consume())Running
        tests-------------Docker is required to run tests. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation
        for installation notes. Also note, that `lz4` compression libraries for python
        will require `python-dev` package,or python source header files for compilation
        on Linux.NOTE: You will also need a valid java installation. It''s required
        for the ``keytool`` utility, used togenerate ssh keys for some tests.Setting
        up tests requirements (assuming you''re within virtualenv on ubuntu 14.04+)::    sudo
        apt-get install -y libsnappy-dev libzstd-dev libkrb5-dev krb5-user    make
        setupRunning tests with coverage::    make covTo run tests with a specific
        version of Kafka (default one is 1.0.2) use KAFKA_VERSION variable::    make
        cov KAFKA_VERSION=0.10.2.1Test running cheatsheat: * ``make test FLAGS="-l
        -x --ff"`` - run until 1 failure, rerun failed tests first. Great for cleaning
        up a lot of errors, say after a big refactor. * ``make test FLAGS="-k consumer"``
        - run only the consumer tests. * ``make test FLAGS="-m ''not ssl''"`` - run
        tests excluding ssl. * ``make test FLAGS="--no-pull"`` - do not try to pull
        new docker image before test run.'

        \ :alt: Gitter chatAnyIO is an asynchronous networking and concurrency library
        that works on top of either asyncio_ ortrio_. It implements trio-like `structured
        concurrency`_ (SC) on top of asyncio and works in harmonywith the native SC
        of trio itself.Applications and libraries written against AnyIO's API will
        run unmodified on either asyncio_ ortrio_. AnyIO can also be adopted into
        a library or application incrementally \u2013 bit by bit, no fullrefactoring
        necessary. It will blend in with the native libraries of your chosen backend.Documentation-------------View
        full documentation at: https://anyio.readthedocs.io/Features--------AnyIO
        offers the following functionality:* Task groups (nurseries_ in trio terminology)*
        High-level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)  * `Happy eyeballs`_ algorithm
        for TCP connections (more robust than that of asyncio on Python    3.8)  *
        async/await style UDP sockets (unlike asyncio where you still have to use
        Transports and    Protocols)* A versatile API for byte streams and object
        streams* Inter-task synchronization and communication (locks, conditions,
        events, semaphores, object  streams)* Worker threads* Subprocesses* Asynchronous
        file I/O (using worker threads)* Signal handlingAnyIO also comes with its
        own pytest_ plugin which also supports asynchronous fixtures.It even works
        with the popular Hypothesis_ library... _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html..

        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asgirefASGI is a standard for Python asynchronous
        web apps and servers to communicatewith each other, and positioned as an asynchronous
        successor to WSGI. You canread more at https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/This
        package includes ASGI base libraries, such as:* Sync-to-async and async-to-sync
        function wrappers, ``asgiref.sync``* Server base classes, ``asgiref.server``*
        A WSGI-to-ASGI adapter, in ``asgiref.wsgi``Function wrappers-----------------These
        allow you to wrap or decorate async or sync functions to call them fromthe
        other style (so you can call async functions from a synchronous thread,or
        vice-versa).In particular:* AsyncToSync lets a synchronous subthread stop
        and wait while the async  function is called on the main thread''s event loop,
        and then control is  returned to the thread when the async function is finished.*
        SyncToAsync lets async code call a synchronous function, which is run in  a
        threadpool and control returned to the async coroutine when the synchronous  function
        completes.The idea is to make it easier to call synchronous APIs from async
        code andasynchronous APIs from synchronous code so it''s easier to transition
        code fromone style to the other. In the case of Channels, we wrap the (synchronous)Django
        view system with SyncToAsync to allow it to run inside the (asynchronous)ASGI
        server.Note that exactly what threads things run in is very specific, and
        aimed tokeep maximum compatibility with old synchronous code. See"Synchronous
        code & Threads" below for a full explanation. By default,``sync_to_async``
        will run all synchronous code in the program in the samethread for safety
        reasons; you can disable this for more performance with``@sync_to_async(thread_sensitive=False)``,
        but make sure that your code doesnot rely on anything bound to threads (like
        database connections) when you do.Threadlocal replacement-----------------------This
        is a drop-in replacement for ``threading.local`` that works with boththreads
        and asyncio Tasks. Even better, it will proxy values through from atask-local
        context to a thread-local context when you use ``sync_to_async``to run things
        in a threadpool, and vice-versa for ``async_to_sync``.If you instead want
        true thread- and task-safety, you can set``thread_critical`` on the Local
        object to ensure this instead.Server base classes-------------------Includes
        a ``StatelessServer`` class which provides all the hard work ofwriting a stateless
        server (as in, does not handle direct incoming socketsbut instead consumes
        external streams or sockets to work out what is happening).An example of such
        a server would be a chatbot server that connects out toa central chat server
        and provides a "connection scope" per user chatting toit. There''s only one
        actual connection, but the server has to separate thingsinto several scopes
        for easier writing of the code.You can see an example of this being used in
        `frequensgi <https://github.com/andrewgodwin/frequensgi>`_.WSGI-to-ASGI adapter--------------------Allows
        you to wrap a WSGI application so it appears as a valid ASGI application.Simply
        wrap it around your WSGI application like so::    asgi_application = WsgiToAsgi(wsgi_application)The
        WSGI application will be run in a synchronous threadpool, and the wrappedASGI
        application will be one that accepts ``http`` class messages.Please note that
        not all extended features of WSGI may be supported (such asfile handles for
        incoming POST bodies).Dependencies------------``asgiref`` requires Python
        3.8 or higher.Contributing------------Please refer to the`main Channels contributing
        docs <https://github.com/django/channels/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.Testing''''''''''''''To
        run tests, make sure you have installed the ``tests`` extra with the package::    cd
        asgiref/    pip install -e .[tests]    pytestBuilding the documentation''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''The
        documentation uses `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_::    cd asgiref/docs/    pip
        install sphinxTo build the docs, you can use the default tools::    sphinx-build
        -b html . _build/html  # or `make html`, if you''ve got make set up    cd
        _build/html    python -m http.server...or you can use ``sphinx-autobuild``
        to run a server and rebuild/reloadyour documentation changes automatically::    pip
        install sphinx-autobuild    sphinx-autobuild . _build/htmlReleasing''''''''''''''''''To
        release, first add details to CHANGELOG.txt and update the version number
        in ``asgiref/__init__.py``.Then, build and push the packages::    python -m
        build    twine upload dist/*    rm -r build/ dist/Implementation Details----------------------Synchronous
        code & threads''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''The ``asgiref.sync``
        module provides two wrappers that let you go betweenasynchronous and synchronous
        code at will, while taking care of the rough edgesfor you.Unfortunately, the
        rough edges are numerous, and the code has to work especiallyhard to keep
        things in the same thread as much as possible. Notably, therestrictions we
        are working with are:* All synchronous code called through ``SyncToAsync``
        and marked with  ``thread_sensitive`` should run in the same thread as each
        other (and if the  outer layer of the program is synchronous, the main thread)*
        If a thread already has a running async loop, ``AsyncToSync`` can''t run things  on
        that loop if it''s blocked on synchronous code that is above you in the  call
        stack.The first compromise you get to might be that ``thread_sensitive`` code
        shouldjust run in the same thread and not spawn in a sub-thread, fulfilling
        the firstrestriction, but that immediately runs you into the second restriction.The
        only real solution is to essentially have a variant of ThreadPoolExecutorthat
        executes any ``thread_sensitive`` code on the outermost synchronousthread
        - either the main thread, or a single spawned subthread.This means you now
        have two basic states:* If the outermost layer of your program is synchronous,
        then all async code  run through ``AsyncToSync`` will run in a per-call event
        loop in arbitrary  sub-threads, while all ``thread_sensitive`` code will run
        in the main thread.* If the outermost layer of your program is asynchronous,
        then all async code  runs on the main thread''s event loop, and all ``thread_sensitive``
        synchronous  code will run in a single shared sub-thread.Crucially, this means
        that in both cases there is a thread which is a sharedresource that all ``thread_sensitive``
        code must run on, and there is a chancethat this thread is currently blocked
        on its own ``AsyncToSync`` call. Thus,``AsyncToSync`` needs to act as an executor
        for thread code while it''s blocking.The ``CurrentThreadExecutor`` class provides
        this functionality; rather thansimply waiting on a Future, you can call its
        ``run_until_future`` method andit will run submitted code until that Future
        is done. This means that codeinside the call can then run code on your thread.Maintenance

        seehttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/.To report bugs

        https://astunparse.readthedocs.org/An AST unparser for Python.This is a factored
        out version of ``unparse`` found in the Pythonsource distribution; under Demo/parser
        in Python 2 and under Tools/parserin Python 3.Basic example::    import inspect    import
        ast    import astunparse    # get back the source code    astunparse.unparse(ast.parse(inspect.getsource(ast)))    #
        get a pretty-printed dump of the AST    astunparse.dump(ast.parse(inspect.getsource(ast)))This
        library is single-source compatible with Python 2.6 through Python 3.5. Itis
        authored by the Python core developers; I have simply merged the Python 2.7and
        the Python 3.5 source and test suites, and added a wrapper. This factoringout
        is to provide a library implementation that supports both versions.Added to
        this is a pretty-printing ``dump`` utility function.The test suite both runs
        specific tests and also roundtrips much of thestandard library.Extensions

        test suite.This library uses mature and core maintained code instead of trying
        to patchexisting libraries. The ``unparse`` and the ``test_unparse`` modulesare

        call returns a context managerthat cancels a block on *timeout* expiring::   from
        async_timeout import timeout   async with timeout(1.5):       await inner()1.
        If ``inner()`` is executed faster than in ``1.5`` seconds nothing   happens.2.
        Otherwise ``inner()`` is cancelled internally by sending   ``asyncio.CancelledError``
        into but ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` is   raised outside of context manager scope.*timeout*
        parameter could be ``None`` for skipping timeout functionality.Alternatively,
        ``timeout_at(when)`` can be used for schedulingat the absolute time::   loop
        = asyncio.get_event_loop()   now = loop.time()   async with timeout_at(now
        + 1.5):       await inner()Please note: it is not POSIX time but a time withundefined
        starting base, e.g. the time of the system power on.Context manager has ``.expired``
        property for check if timeout happensexactly in context manager::   async
        with timeout(1.5) as cm:       await inner()   print(cm.expired)The property
        is ``True`` if ``inner()`` execution is cancelled bytimeout context manager.If
        ``inner()`` call explicitly raises ``TimeoutError`` ``cm.expired``is ``False``.The
        scheduled deadline time is available as ``.deadline`` property::   async with
        timeout(1.5) as cm:       cm.deadlineNot finished yet timeout can be rescheduled
        by ``shift_by()``or ``shift_to()`` methods::   async with timeout(1.5) as
        cm:       cm.shift(1)  # add another second on waiting       cm.update(loop.time()
        + 5)  # reschedule to now+5 secondsRescheduling is forbidden if the timeout
        is expired or after exit from ``async with``code block.Installation------------::   $
        pip install async-timeoutThe library is Python 3 only!Authors and License-------------------The

        *cache* is a mutable_ mapping_ of afixed maximum size.  When the cache is
        full, i.e. by adding anotheritem the cache would exceed its maximum size,
        the cache must choosewhich item(s) to discard based on a suitable `cache algorithm`_.This
        module provides multiple cache classes based on different cachealgorithms,
        as well as decorators for easily memoizing function andmethod calls.Installation------------------------------------------------------------------------cachetools

        \U0001F607 WhyWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited
        to my expectations, and I wanted to propose areliable alternative using a
        completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!I
        **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different
        tables** canproduce **two identical rendered string.**What I want is to get
        readable text, the best I can. In a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.**
        How cool is that ? \U0001F60EDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer
        or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer
        to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.## \U0001F370 How  - Discard
        all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.  - Measure
        noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.
        \ - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.  - Additionally, we measure
        coherence / probe for a language.**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and
        coherence according to **YOU ?***Noise :* I opened hundred of text files,
        **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then**I
        established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems
        like** a mess. I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably
        incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to improve or rewrite it.*Coherence
        :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance
        occurrences (the best we can). So I thoughtthat intel is worth something here.
        So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent
        design.## \u26A1 Known limitations  - Language detection is unreliable when
        text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english
        tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))  - Every charset detector
        heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run
        detection on very tiny content.## \u26A0\uFE0F About Python EOLs**If you are

        At least 2x faster than Chardet.- Accent has been made on UTF-8 detection,
        should perform rather instantaneous.- The backward compatibility with Chardet
        has been greatly improved. The legacy detect function returns an identical
        charset name whenever possible.- The detection mechanism has been slightly
        improved, now Turkish content is detected correctly (most of the time)- The
        program has been rewritten to ease the readability and maintainability. (+Using
        static typing)+- utf_7 detection has been reinstated.### Removed- This package

        w_counter, chaos_secondary_pass of the class CharsetMatch are now deprecated
        and scheduled for removal in v3.0### Fixed- The CLI output used the relative
        path of the file(s). Should be absolute.## [1.4.1](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1)
        (2021-05-28)### Fixed- Logger configuration/usage no longer conflict with

        (2021-05-21)### Removed- Using standard logging instead of using the package
        loguru.- Dropping nose test framework in favor of the maintained pytest.-
        Choose to not use dragonmapper package to help with gibberish Chinese/CJK
        text.- Require cached_property only for Python 3.5 due to constraint. Dropping
        for every other interpreter version.- Stop support for UTF-7 that does not
        contain a SIG.- Dropping PrettyTable, replaced with pure JSON output in CLI.###
        Fixed- BOM marker in a CharsetNormalizerMatch instance could be False in rare
        cases even if obviously present. Due to the sub-match factoring process.-
        Not searching properly for the BOM when trying utf32/16 parent codec.### Changed-
        Improving the package final size by compressing frequencies.json.- Huge improvement
        over the larges payload.### Added- CLI now produces JSON consumable output.-
        Return ASCII if given sequences fit. Given reasonable confidence.## [1.3.9](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.8...1.3.9)
        (2021-05-13)### Fixed- In some very rare cases, you may end up getting encode/decode
        errors due to a bad bytes payload (PR #40)## [1.3.8](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.7...1.3.8)
        (2021-05-12)### Fixed- Empty given payload for detection may cause an exception
        if trying to access the `alphabets` property. (PR #39)## [1.3.7](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.6...1.3.7)
        (2021-05-12)### Fixed- The legacy detect function should return UTF-8-SIG
        if sig is present in the payload. (PR #38)## [1.3.6](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.5...1.3.6)
        (2021-02-09)### Changed- Amend the previous release to allow prettytable 2.0
        (PR #35)## [1.3.5](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.4...1.3.5)
        (2021-02-08)### Fixed- Fix error while using the package with a python pre-release
        interpreter (PR #33)### Changed- Dependencies refactoring, constraints revised.###

        fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+
        based on standard Python type hints.The key features are:* **Fast**: Very
        high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and
        Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).*
        **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to
        300%. ** **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
        ** **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title=\"also known as auto-complete,
        autocompletion, IntelliSense\">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.*
        **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.* **Short**:
        Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
        Fewer bugs.* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive
        documentation.* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with)
        the open standards for APIs: <a href=\"https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification\"
        class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as

        <a href=\"https://docs.pydantic.dev/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Pydantic</a>
        for the data parts.## Installation<div class=\"termy\">```console$ pip install
        fastapi---> 100%```</div>You will also need an ASGI server, for production
        such as <a href=\"https://www.uvicorn.org\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Uvicorn</a>
        or <a href=\"https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn\" class=\"external-link\"

        \"uvicorn[standard]\"---> 100%```</div>## Example### Create it* Create a file
        `main.py` with:```Pythonfrom typing import Unionfrom fastapi import FastAPIapp
        = FastAPI()@app.get(\"/\")def read_root():    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")def

        item_id, \"q\": q}```<details markdown=\"1\"><summary>Or use <code>async def</code>...</summary>If
        your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:```Python hl_lines=\"9  14\"from
        typing import Unionfrom fastapi import FastAPIapp = FastAPI()@app.get(\"/\")async
        def read_root():    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")async

        <code>uvicorn main:app --reload</code>...</summary>The command `uvicorn main:app`
        refers to:* `main`: the file `main.py` (the Python \"module\").* `app`: the
        object created inside of `main.py` with the line `app = FastAPI()`.* `--reload`:
        make the server restart after code changes. Only do this for development.</details>###

        will see the JSON response as:```JSON{\"item_id\": 5, \"q\": \"somequery\"}```You
        already created an API that:* Receives HTTP requests in the _paths_ `/` and
        `/items/{item_id}`.* Both _paths_ take `GET` <em>operations</em> (also known
        as HTTP _methods_).* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has a _path parameter_
        `item_id` that should be an `int`.* The _path_ `/items/{item_id}` has an optional

        Example upgradeNow modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT`
        request.Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.```Python

        pydantic import BaseModelapp = FastAPI()class Item(BaseModel):    name: str

        \   return {\"item_name\": item.name, \"item_id\": item_id}```The server should
        reload automatically (because you added `--reload` to the `uvicorn` command
        above).### Interactive API docs upgradeNow go to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs\"

        Then click on the \"Execute\" button, the user interface will communicate
        with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:![Swagger

        RecapIn summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc.
        as function parameters.You do that with standard modern Python types.You don't
        have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library,
        etc.Just standard **Python 3.8+**.For example, for an `int`:```Pythonitem_id:
        int```or for a more complex `Item` model:```Pythonitem: Item```...and with
        that single declaration you get:* Editor support, including:    * Completion.
        \   * Type checks.* Validation of data:    * Automatic and clear errors when
        the data is invalid.    * Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.*
        <abbr title=\"also known as: serialization, parsing, marshalling\">Conversion</abbr>
        of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
        \   * JSON.    * Path parameters.    * Query parameters.    * Cookies.    *
        Headers.    * Forms.    * Files.* <abbr title=\"also known as: serialization,
        parsing, marshalling\">Conversion</abbr> of output data: converting from Python
        data and types to network data (as JSON):    * Convert Python types (`str`,
        `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).    * `datetime` objects.    * `UUID`
        objects.    * Database models.    * ...and many more.* Automatic interactive
        API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:    * Swagger UI.
        \   * ReDoc.---Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:*
        Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.*
        Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
        \   * If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.* Check if there
        is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`)
        for `GET` requests.    * As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it
        is optional.    * Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body
        in the case with `PUT`).* For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, Read the
        body as JSON:    * Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should
        be a `str`.    * Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to
        be a `float`.    * Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that
        should be a `bool`, if present.    * All this would also work for deeply nested
        JSON objects.* Convert from and to JSON automatically.* Document everything
        with OpenAPI, that can be used by:    * Interactive documentation systems.
        \   * Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.* Provide
        2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly.---We just scratched the
        surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.Try changing the
        line with:```Python    return {\"item_name\": item.name, \"item_id\": item_id}```...from:```Python
        \       ... \"item_name\": item.name ...```...to:```Python        ... \"item_price\":
        item.price ...```...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes
        and know their types:![editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)For
        a more complete example including more features, see the <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/\">Tutorial
        - User Guide</a>.**Spoiler alert**: the tutorial - user guide includes:* Declaration
        of **parameters** from other different places as: **headers**, **cookies**,
        **form fields** and **files**.* How to set **validation constraints** as `maximum_length`
        or `regex`.* A very powerful and easy to use **<abbr title=\"also known as

        system.* Security and authentication, including support for **OAuth2** with
        **JWT tokens** and **HTTP Basic** auth.* More advanced (but equally easy)
        techniques for declaring **deeply nested JSON models** (thanks to Pydantic).*
        **GraphQL** integration with <a href=\"https://strawberry.rocks\" class=\"external-link\"
        target=\"_blank\">Strawberry</a> and other libraries.* Many extra features
        (thanks to Starlette) as:    * **WebSockets**    * extremely easy tests based

        Installation and Requirements===============================.. _installation:..  This
        file is included in README.rst so it is limited to plain  ReST markup, not
        Sphinx... note::   If you are reading this document on the `Python Package
        Index`_   (PyPI, https://pypi.org/), it is specific to the version of gevent
        that   you are viewing. If you are viewing this document on gevent.org, it   refers
        to the current state of gevent in source control (git   master).Supported
        Platforms===================This version of gevent runs on Python 3.8 and
        up, (for exact detailsof tested versions, see the classifiers on the PyPI
        page or in``setup.py``). gevent requires the `greenlet<https://greenlet.readthedocs.io>`_
        library and will install the`cffi`_ library by default on Windows. The cffi
        library will becomethe default on all platforms in a future release of gevent.This
        version of gevent is also tested on on PyPy 3.10 (7.3.12); itshould run on
        PyPy 3.9 and above. On PyPy, there are no externaldependencies.gevent is tested
        on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and should run on mostother Unix-like operating
        systems (e.g., FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.).. note::   Windows is supported as
        a tier 2, "best effort," platform. It is   suitable for development, but not
        recommended for production. In   particular, PyPy3 on Windows may have issues,
        especially with   subprocesses.   On Windows using the deprecated libev backend,
        gevent is   limited to a maximum of 1024 open sockets due to   `limitations
        in libev`_. This limitation should not exist   with the default libuv backend.Older
        Versions of Python------------------------Users of older versions of Python
        2 or Python 3 may install an olderversion of gevent. Note that these versions
        are generally notsupported.+-------+-------+|Python |Gevent ||Version|Version|+=======+=======+|2.5    |1.0.x  ||       |       |+-------+-------+|2.6    |1.1.x  |+-------+-------+|<=     |1.2.x  ||2.7.8  |       |+-------+-------+|3.3    |1.2.x  |+-------+-------+|3.4.0

        note::   This section is about installing released versions of gevent as   distributed
        on the `Python Package Index`_. For building gevent   from source, including
        customizing the build and embedded   libraries, see `Installing From Source`_...
        _Python Package Index: http://pypi.org/project/geventgevent and greenlet can
        both be installed with `pip`_, e.g., ``pipinstall gevent``. Installation using
        `buildout<http://docs.buildout.org/en/latest/>`_ is also supported.On Windows,
        macOS, and Linux, both gevent and greenlet aredistributed as binary `wheels`_...
        tip::   You need Pip 8.0 or later, or buildout 2.10.0 to install the binary   wheels
        on Windows or macOS. On Linux, you''ll need `pip 19   <https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5008>`_
        to install the   manylinux2010 wheels... tip::   While the x86-64 binaries
        are considered production quality, they   are built with relatively low optimization
        levels and no hardware   specific optimizations. Serious production users
        are encouraged to   install from source with appropriate compiler flags...
        tip::   Beginning with gevent 20.12.0, 64-bit ARM binaries are distributed   on
        PyPI for aarch64 manylinux2014 compatible systems. Installing these   needs
        a very recent version of ``pip``. These wheels *do not*   contain the c-ares
        resolver, are not tested, and are built with   very low levels of optimizations.
        Serious production users of   gevent on 64-bit ARM systems are encouraged
        to build their own   binary wheels.   Beginning with gevent 22.10.0, ppc64le
        binaries are distributed on   PyPI. The same caveats apply as for 64-bit ARM
        binaries. Using them   for anything other than local development is discouraged.   Beginning
        with gevent 23, muslinux aarch64 and S390X binaries   are distributed on PyPI.
        The same caveats apply as for 64-bit ARM   binaries. Using them for anything
        other than local development is   discouraged.Installing From Source----------------------If
        you are unable to use the binary wheels (for platforms where nopre-built wheels
        are available or if wheel installation is disabled),you can build gevent from
        source. A normal ``pip install`` willfall back to doing this if no binary
        wheel is available. See`Installing From Source`_ for more, including common
        installation issues.Extra Dependencies==================There are a numberof
        additional libraries that extend gevent''s functionality and will beused if
        they are available. All of these may be installed using`setuptools extras<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies>`_,as
        named below, e.g., ``pip install gevent[events]``.events    In versions of
        gevent up to and including 20.5.0, this provided configurable    event support
        using `zope.event    <https://pypi.org/project/zope.event>`_ and was highly    recommended.    In
        versions after that, this extra is empty and does nothing. It    will be removed
        in gevent 21.0.dnspython    Enables a pure-Python resolver, backed by `dnspython    <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython>`_.
        On Python 2, this also    includes `idna <https://pypi.org/project/idna>`_.
        They can be    installed with the ``dnspython`` extra.    .. note:: This is
        not compatible with Python 3.10+ or dnspython 2.monitor    Enhancements to
        gevent''s self-monitoring capabilities. This    includes the `psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil>`_
        library    which is needed to monitor memory usage. (Note that this may not    build
        on all platforms.)recommended    A shortcut for installing suggested extras
        together. This includes    the non-test extras defined here, plus additions
        that improve    gevent''s operation on certain platforms (for example, in
        the past,    it has included backports of newer APIs).test    Everything needed
        to run the complete gevent test suite... _`pip`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/..

      Description: '.. This file is included into docs/history.rstGreenlets are lightweight
        coroutines for in-process concurrentprogramming.The "greenlet" package is
        a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version ofCPython that supports micro-threads
        called "tasklets". Tasklets runpseudo-concurrently (typically in a single
        or a few OS-level threads)and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".A
        "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion ofmicro-thread
        with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.This is useful when
        you want to control exactly when your code runs.You can build custom scheduled
        micro-threads on top of greenlet;however, it seems that greenlets are useful
        on their own as a way tomake advanced control flow structures. For example,
        we can recreategenerators; the difference with Python''s own generators is
        that ourgenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions canyield
        values too. (Additionally, you don''t need a "yield" keyword. Seethe example
        in `test_generator.py<https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/blob/adca19bf1f287b3395896a8f41f3f4fd1797fdc7/src/greenlet/tests/test_generator.py#L1>`_).Greenlets
        are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodifiedinterpreter...
        _`Stackless`: http://www.stackless.comWho is using Greenlet?======================There
        are several libraries that use Greenlet as a more flexiblealternative to Python''s
        built in coroutine support: - `Concurrence`_ - `Eventlet`_ - `Gevent`_.. _Concurrence:

        _Gevent: http://www.gevent.org/Getting Greenlet================The easiest
        way to get Greenlet is to install it with pip::  pip install greenletSource

        http://h11.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest   :alt: Documentation StatusThis
        is a little HTTP/1.1 library written from scratch in Python,heavily inspired
        by `hyper-h2 <https://hyper-h2.readthedocs.io/>`_.It''s a "bring-your-own-I/O"
        library; h11 contains no IO codewhatsoever. This means you can hook h11 up
        to your favorite networkAPI, and that could be anything you want: synchronous,
        threaded,asynchronous, or your own implementation of `RFC 6214<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6214>`_
        -- h11 won''t judge you.(Compare this to the current state of the art, where
        every time a `newnetwork API <https://trio.readthedocs.io/>`_ comes along
        then someonegets to start over reimplementing the entire HTTP protocol fromscratch.)
        Cory Benfield made an `excellent blog post describing thebenefits of this
        approach<https://lukasa.co.uk/2015/10/The_New_Hyper/>`_, or if you like videothen
        here''s his `PyCon 2016 talk on the same theme<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cC3_jGwl_U>`_.This
        also means that h11 is not immediately useful out of the box:it''s a toolkit
        for building programs that speak HTTP, not somethingthat could directly replace
        ``requests`` or ``twisted.web`` orwhatever. But h11 makes it much easier to
        implement something like``requests`` or ``twisted.web``.At a high level, working
        with h11 goes like this:1) First, create an ``h11.Connection`` object to track
        the state of a   single HTTP/1.1 connection.2) When you read data off the
        network, pass it to   ``conn.receive_data(...)``; you''ll get back a list
        of objects   representing high-level HTTP "events".3) When you want to send
        a high-level HTTP event, create the   corresponding "event" object and pass
        it to ``conn.send(...)``;   this will give you back some bytes that you can
        then push out   through the network.For example, a client might instantiate
        and then send a``h11.Request`` object, then zero or more ``h11.Data`` objects
        for therequest body (e.g., if this is a POST), and then a``h11.EndOfMessage``
        to indicate the end of the message. Then theserver would then send back a
        ``h11.Response``, some ``h11.Data``, andits own ``h11.EndOfMessage``. If either
        side violates the protocol,you''ll get a ``h11.ProtocolError`` exception.h11
        is suitable for implementing both servers and clients, and has apleasantly
        symmetric API: the events you send as a client are exactlythe ones that you
        receive as a server and vice-versa.`Here''s an example of a tiny HTTP client<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/examples/basic-client.py>`_It
        also has `a fine manual <https://h11.readthedocs.io/>`_.FAQ---*Whyyyyy?*I
        wanted to play with HTTP in `Curio<https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`__
        and `Trio<https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__, which at the time didn''t have
        anyHTTP libraries. So I thought, no big deal, Python has, like, a dozendifferent
        implementations of HTTP, surely I can find one that''sreusable. I didn''t
        find one, but I did find Cory''s call-to-armsblog-post. So I figured, well,
        fine, if I have to implement HTTP fromscratch, at least I can make sure no-one
        *else* has to ever again.*Should I use it?*Maybe. You should be aware that
        it''s a very young project. But, it''sfeature complete and has an exhaustive
        test-suite and complete docs,so the next step is for people to try using it
        and see how it goes:-). If you do then please let us know -- if nothing else
        we''ll wantto talk to you before making any incompatible changes!*What are
        the features/limitations?*Roughly speaking, it''s trying to be a robust, complete,
        and non-hackyimplementation of the first "chapter" of the HTTP/1.1 spec: `RFC
        7230:HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230>`_.
        That is, it mostly focuses onimplementing HTTP at the level of taking bytes
        on and off the wire,and the headers related to that, and tries to be anal
        about specconformance. It doesn''t know about higher-level concerns like URLrouting,
        conditional GETs, cross-origin cookie policies, or contentnegotiation. But
        it does know how to take care of framing,cross-version differences in keep-alive
        handling, and the "obsoleteline folding" rule, so you can focus your energies
        on the hard /interesting parts for your application, and it tries to support
        thefull specification in the sense that any useful HTTP/1.1 conformantapplication
        should be able to use h11.It''s pure Python, and has no dependencies outside
        of the standardlibrary.It has a test suite with 100.0% coverage for both statements
        andbranches.Currently it supports Python 3 (testing on 3.7-3.10) and PyPy
        3.The last Python 2-compatible version was h11 0.11.x.(Originally it had a
        Cython wrapper for `http-parser<https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser>`_ and
        a beautiful nested statemachine implemented with ``yield from`` to postprocess
        the output. ButI had to take these out -- the new *parser* needs fewer lines-of-codethan
        the old *parser wrapper*, is written in pure Python, uses noexotic language
        syntax, and has more features. It''s sad, really; thatold state machine was
        really slick. I just need a few sentences hereto mourn that.)I don''t know
        how fast it is. I haven''t benchmarked or profiled it yet,so it''s probably
        got a few pointless hot spots, and I''ve been tryingto err on the side of
        simplicity and robustness instead ofmicro-optimization. But at the architectural
        level I tried hard toavoid fundamentally bad decisions, e.g., I believe that
        all theparsing algorithms remain linear-time even in the face of pathologicalinput
        like slowloris, and there are no byte-by-byte loops. (I alsobelieve that it
        maintains bounded memory usage in the face ofarbitrary/pathological input.)The
        whole library is ~800 lines-of-code. You can read and understandthe whole
        thing in less than an hour. Most of the energy invested inthis so far has
        been spent on trying to keep things simple byminimizing special-cases and
        ad hoc state manipulation; even though itis now quite small and simple, I''m
        still annoyed that I haven''tfigured out how to make it even smaller and simpler.
        (Unfortunately,HTTP does not lend itself to simplicity.)The API is ~feature
        complete and I don''t expect the general outlinesto change much, but you can''t
        judge an API''s ergonomics until youactually document and use it, so I''d
        expect some changes in thedetails.*How do I try it?*.. code-block:: sh  $

      Description: The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface
        to the HDF5library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be
        a completewrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component supports  access
        toHDF5 files, datasets and groups using established Python and NumPy concepts.A
        strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy) datatypes anddata
        structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly simplifies the process ofreading
        and writing data from Python.Wheels are provided for several popular platforms,
        with an included copy ofthe HDF5 library (usually the latest version when
        h5py is released).You can also `build h5py from source<https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/build.html#source-installation>`_with
        any HDF5 stable release from version 1.10.4 onwards, although naturally newHDF5
        versions released after this version of h5py may not work.Odd-numbered minor
        versions of HDF5 (e.g. 1.13) are experimental, and may notbe supported.

      Description: "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)=====================================================Support
        for the Internationalized Domain Names inApplications (IDNA) protocol as specified
        in `RFC 5891<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_. This is the latest version
        ofthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as \u201CIDNA 2008\u201D.This
        library also provides support for Unicode TechnicalStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA
        Compatibility Processing<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.This acts as
        a suitable replacement for the \u201Cencodings.idna\u201Dmodule that comes
        with the Python standard library, but whichonly supports the older superseded
        IDNA specification (`RFC 3490<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).Basic
        functions are simply executed:.. code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna    >>>
        idna.encode('\u30C9\u30E1\u30A4\u30F3.\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8')    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'

        package is available for installation from PyPI:.. code-block:: bash    $
        python3 -m pip install idnaUsage-----For typical usage, the ``encode`` and
        ``decode`` functions will take adomain name argument and perform a conversion
        to A-labels or U-labelsrespectively... code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna
        \   >>> idna.encode('\u30C9\u30E1\u30A4\u30F3.\u30C6\u30B9\u30C8')    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'

        may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the``idna.codec`` module:..
        code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna.codec    >>> print('\u0434\u043E\u043C\u0435\u043D.\u0438\u0441\u043F\u044B\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0438\u0435'.encode('idna2008'))

        can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or``alabel`` functions
        if necessary:.. code-block:: pycon    >>> idna.alabel('\u6D4B\u8BD5')    b'xn--0zwm56d'Compatibility
        Mapping (UTS #46)+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++As described in `RFC 5895
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, theIDNA specification does not normalize
        input from different potentialways a user may input a domain name. This functionality,
        known asa \u201Cmapping\u201D, is considered by the specification to be a
        localuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.This
        library provides one such mapping that was developed by theUnicode Consortium.
        Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_,
        it provides for both a regularmapping for typical applications, as well as
        a transitional mapping tohelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.For
        example, \u201CK\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen\u201D is not a permissible label as
        *LATINCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).UTS
        46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNAconversion...
        code-block:: pycon    >>> import idna    >>> idna.encode('K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen')
        \   ...    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen'
        not allowed    >>> idna.encode('K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen', uts46=True)    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'
        \   >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))    k\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchenTransitional
        processing provides conversions to help transition fromthe older 2003 standard
        to the current standard. For example, in theoriginal IDNA specification, the
        *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (\xDF) wasconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER
        S* (ss), whereas in the currentIDNA specification this conversion is not performed...
        code-block:: pycon    >>> idna.encode('K\xF6nigsg\xE4\xDFchen', uts46=True,
        transitional=True)    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'Implementers should use transitional
        processing with caution, only inrare cases where conversion from legacy labels
        to current labels must beperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date
        2008). For typicalapplications that just need to convert labels, transitional
        processingis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatibleresults.``encodings.idna``
        Compatibility++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Function calls from the Python
        built-in ``encodings.idna`` module aremapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents
        using the ``idna.compat`` module.Simply substitute the ``import`` clause in
        your code to refer to the newmodule name.Exceptions----------All errors raised
        during the conversion following the specificationshould raise an exception
        derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` baseclass.More specific exceptions that
        may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``when the error reflects an illegal
        combination of left-to-right andright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint``
        whena specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.INVALID);
        and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint isillegal based on
        its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJbut the contextual
        requirements are not satisfied.)Building and Diagnostics------------------------The
        IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookuptables for
        performance. These tables are derived from computing againsteligibility criteria
        in the respective standards. These tables arecomputed using the command-line
        script ``tools/idna-data``.This tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from
        the Unicode repositoryand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility.
        There arethree main modes:* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py``
        and  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and
        \ UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against
        \ a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a  different
        version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.* ``idna-data make-table``.
        Generate a table of the IDNA disposition  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO)
        in the format found in Appendix  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables
        published by `IANA  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints
        debugging output on the various  properties associated with an individual
        Unicode codepoint (in this  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA
        and UTS 46 status of a  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.The
        tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data-h``. Most
        notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specificationof the version
        of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. Forexample, ``idna-data
        --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generatelibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.Additional
        Notes----------------* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is
        published in the  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.*
        **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.  As this
        library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of  applications, many
        of which strive for broad compatibility with older  Python versions, there
        is no rush to remove older interpreter support.  Removing support for older
        versions should be well justified in that the  maintenance burden has become
        too high.* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.
        \ While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable  issues
        being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your  requirements
        file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.* **Testing**. The
        library has a test suite based on each rule of the  IDNA specification, as
        well as tests that are provided as part of the  Unicode Technical Standard
        46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.*
        **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in  this library.
        Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by  the technical standard
        IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased  out across the domain industry
        due to associated security risks. For  now, applications that need to support
        these non-compliant labels  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode
        operation in this library  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`.

        discussion."

      Description: '# Keras 3: Deep Learning for HumansKeras 3 is a multi-backend
        deep learning framework, with support for JAX, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.Effortlessly
        build and train models for computer vision, natural language processing, audio
        processing,timeseries forecasting, recommender systems, etc.- **Accelerated
        model development**: Ship deep learning solutions faster thanks to the high-level
        UX of Kerasand the availability of easy-to-debug runtimes like PyTorch or
        JAX eager execution.- **State-of-the-art performance**: By picking the backend
        that is the fastest for your model architecture (often JAX!),leverage speedups
        ranging from 20% to 350% compared to other frameworks. [Benchmark here](https://keras.io/getting_started/benchmarks/).-
        **Datacenter-scale training**: Scale confidently from your laptop to large
        clusters of GPUs or TPUs.Join nearly three million developers, from burgeoning
        startups to global enterprises, in harnessing the power of Keras 3.## Installation###
        Install with pipKeras 3 is available on PyPI as `keras`. Note that Keras 2
        remains available as the `tf-keras` package.1. Install `keras`:```pip install
        keras --upgrade```2. Install backend package(s).To use `keras`, you should
        also install the backend of choice: `tensorflow`, `jax`, or `torch`.Note that
        `tensorflow` is required for using certain Keras 3 features: certain preprocessing
        layersas well as `tf.data` pipelines.### Local installation#### Minimal installationKeras
        3 is compatible with Linux and MacOS systems. For Windows users, we recommend
        using WSL2 to run Keras.To install a local development version:1. Install
        dependencies:```pip install -r requirements.txt```2. Run installation command
        from the root directory.```python pip_build.py --install```3. Run API generation
        script when creating PRs that update `keras_export` public APIs:```./shell/api_gen.sh```####
        Adding GPU supportThe `requirements.txt` file will install a CPU-only version
        of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. For GPU support, we alsoprovide a separate
        `requirements-{backend}-cuda.txt` for TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. These
        install all CUDAdependencies via `pip` and expect a NVIDIA driver to be pre-installed.
        We recommend a clean python environment for eachbackend to avoid CUDA version
        mismatches. As an example, here is how to create a Jax GPU environment with
        `conda`:```shellconda create -y -n keras-jax python=3.10conda activate keras-jaxpip
        install -r requirements-jax-cuda.txtpython pip_build.py --install```## Configuring
        your backendYou can export the environment variable `KERAS_BACKEND` or you
        can edit your local config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`to configure your
        backend. Available backend options are: `"tensorflow"`, `"jax"`, `"torch"`.
        Example:```export KERAS_BACKEND="jax"```In Colab, you can do:```pythonimport
        osos.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"import keras```**Note:** The backend
        must be configured before importing `keras`, and the backend cannot be changed
        after the package has been imported.## Backwards compatibilityKeras 3 is intended
        to work as a drop-in replacement for `tf.keras` (when using the TensorFlow
        backend). Just take yourexisting `tf.keras` code, make sure that your calls
        to `model.save()` are using the up-to-date `.keras` format, and you''redone.If
        your `tf.keras` model does not include custom components, you can start running
        it on top of JAX or PyTorch immediately.If it does include custom components
        (e.g. custom layers or a custom `train_step()`), it is usually possible to
        convert itto a backend-agnostic implementation in just a few minutes.In addition,
        Keras models can consume datasets in any format, regardless of the backend
        you''re using:you can train your models with your existing `tf.data.Dataset`
        pipelines or PyTorch `DataLoaders`.## Why use Keras 3?- Run your high-level
        Keras workflows on top of any framework -- benefiting at will from the advantages
        of each framework,e.g. the scalability and performance of JAX or the production
        ecosystem options of TensorFlow.- Write custom components (e.g. layers, models,
        metrics) that you can use in low-level workflows in any framework.    - You
        can take a Keras model and train it in a training loop written from scratch
        in native TF, JAX, or PyTorch.    - You can take a Keras model and use it
        as part of a PyTorch-native `Module` or as part of a JAX-native model function.-
        Make your ML code future-proof by avoiding framework lock-in.- As a PyTorch
        user: get access to power and usability of Keras, at last!- As a JAX user:
        get access to a fully-featured, battle-tested, well-documented modeling and
        training library.Read more in the [Keras 3 release announcement](https://keras.io/keras_3/).'

        repository contains code taken from [the LLVM project][1], to make it easier
        to installclang''s python bindings.The repository copies necessary Python
        binding files from LLVM repo, adds packaging scriptsto make it a valid Python
        package and finally uploads the package to [pypi][2]. To make the libclangavailable
        without installing the LLVM toolkits, this package provides bundled static-linked
        libclangshared library for different platforms, which, should work well on
        OSX, Windows, as well asusual Linux distributions.The aim of this project
        is to make the `clang.cindex` (aka., Clang Python Bindings)available for more
        Python users, without setting up the LLVM environment. To install the package,you
        just need to run```bashpip install libclang```Note that the library is named
        `libclang`, the package `clang` on PyPi is another package anddoesn''t bundle
        the prebuilt shared library.Internals---------Update class variable `library_path`
        of `Config` in `cindex.py` as:```python    library_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)),
        ''native'')```License-------This repository follows the license agreement

        version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ml_dtypes.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ml_dtypes)`ml_dtypes`
        is a stand-alone implementation of several NumPy dtype extensions used in
        machine learning libraries, including:- [`bfloat16`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format):  an
        alternative to the standard [`float16`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format)
        format- `float8_*`: several experimental 8-bit floating point representations  including:  *
        `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`  * `float8_e4m3fn`  * `float8_e4m3fnuz`  * `float8_e5m2`  *
        `float8_e5m2fnuz`- `int4` and `uint4`: low precision integer types.See below
        for specifications of these number formats.## InstallationThe `ml_dtypes`
        package is tested with Python versions 3.9-3.12, and can be installedwith
        the following command:```pip install ml_dtypes```To test your installation,
        you can run the following:```pip install absl-py pytestpytest --pyargs ml_dtypes```To
        build from source, clone the repository and run:```git submodule initgit submodule
        updatepip install .```## Example Usage```python>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16>>>
        import numpy as np>>> np.zeros(4, dtype=bfloat16)array([0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=bfloat16)```Importing
        `ml_dtypes` also registers the data types with numpy, so that they maybe referred
        to by their string name:```python>>> np.dtype(''bfloat16'')dtype(bfloat16)>>>
        np.dtype(''float8_e5m2'')dtype(float8_e5m2)```## Specifications of implemented
        floating point formats### `bfloat16`A `bfloat16` number is a single-precision
        float truncated at 16 bits.Exponent: 8, Mantissa: 7, exponent bias: 127. IEEE
        754, with NaN and inf.### `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`Exponent: 4, Mantissa: 3, bias:
        11.Extended range: no inf, NaN represented by 0b1000''0000.### `float8_e4m3fn`Exponent:
        4, Mantissa: 3, bias: 7.Extended range: no inf, NaN represented by 0bS111''1111.The
        `fn` suffix is for consistency with the corresponding LLVM/MLIR type, signaling
        this type is not consistent with IEEE-754.  The `f` indicates it is finite
        values only. The `n` indicates it includes NaNs, but only at the outer range.###
        `float8_e4m3fnuz`8-bit floating point with 3 bit mantissa.An 8-bit floating
        point type with 1 sign bit, 4 bits exponent and 3 bits mantissa. The suffix
        `fnuz` is consistent with LLVM/MLIR naming and is derived from the differences
        to IEEE floating point conventions. `F` is for "finite" (no infinities), `N`
        for with special NaN encoding, `UZ` for unsigned zero.This type has the following
        characteristics: * bit encoding: S1E4M3 - `0bSEEEEMMM` * exponent bias: 8
        * infinities: Not supported * NaNs: Supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent
        bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000` * denormals when exponent
        is 0### `float8_e5m2`Exponent: 5, Mantissa: 2, bias: 15. IEEE 754, with NaN
        and inf.### `float8_e5m2fnuz`8-bit floating point with 2 bit mantissa.An 8-bit
        floating point type with 1 sign bit, 5 bits exponent and 2 bits mantissa.
        The suffix `fnuz` is consistent with LLVM/MLIR naming and is derived from
        the differences to IEEE floating point conventions. `F` is for "finite" (no
        infinities), `N` for with special NaN encoding, `UZ` for unsigned zero.This
        type has the following characteristics: * bit encoding: S1E5M2 - `0bSEEEEEMM`
        * exponent bias: 16 * infinities: Not supported * NaNs: Supported with sign
        bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`
        * denormals when exponent is 0## `int4` and `uint4`4-bit integer types, where
        each element is represented unpacked (i.e., padded upto a byte in memory).NumPy
        does not support types smaller than a single byte. For example, thedistance
        between adjacent elements in an array (`.strides`) is expressed inbytes. Relaxing
        this restriction would be a considerable engineering project.The `int4` and
        `uint4` types therefore use an unpacked representation, whereeach element
        of the array is padded up to a byte in memory. The lower four bitsof each
        byte contain the representation of the number, whereas the upper fourbits
        are ignored.## Quirks of low-precision ArithmeticIf you''re exploring the
        use of low-precision dtypes in your code, you should becareful to anticipate
        when the precision loss might lead to surprising results.One example is the
        behavior of aggregations like `sum`; consider this `bfloat16`summation in
        NumPy (run with version 1.24.2):```python>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16>>>
        import numpy as np>>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=0)>>> vals = rng.uniform(size=10000).astype(bfloat16)>>>
        vals.sum()256```The true sum should be close to 5000, but numpy returns exactly
        256: this isbecause `bfloat16` does not have the precision to increment `256`
        by values less than`1`:```python>>> bfloat16(256) + bfloat16(1)256```After
        256, the next representable value in bfloat16 is 258:```python>>> np.nextafter(bfloat16(256),
        bfloat16(np.inf))258```For better results you can specify that the accumulation
        should happen in ahigher-precision type like `float32`:```python>>> vals.sum(dtype=''float32'').astype(bfloat16)4992```In
        contrast to NumPy, projects like [JAX](http://jax.readthedocs.io/) which supportlow-precision
        arithmetic more natively will often do these kinds of higher-precisionaccumulations
        automatically:```python>>> import jax.numpy as jnp>>> jnp.array(vals).sum()Array(4992,
        dtype=bfloat16)```## License*This is not an officially supported Google product.*The

      Description: "# MLServerAn open source inference server for your machine learning
        models.[![video_play_icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10466106/151803854-75d17c32-541c-4eee-b589-d45b07ea486d.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHe3z-8C_w)##
        OverviewMLServer aims to provide an easy way to start serving your machine
        learningmodels through a REST and gRPC interface, fully compliant with [KFServing's
        V2Dataplane](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/reference/apis/v2-protocol.html)spec.
        Watch a quick video introducing the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHe3z-8C_w).-
        Multi-model serving, letting users run multiple models within the same  process.-
        Ability to run [inference in parallel for vertical  scaling](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/parallel-inference.html)
        \ across multiple models through a pool of inference workers.- Support for
        [adaptive  batching](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/adaptive-batching.html),
        \ to group inference requests together on the fly.- Scalability with deployment
        in Kubernetes native frameworks, including  [Seldon Core](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/graph/protocols.html#v2-kfserving-protocol)
        and  [KServe (formerly known as KFServing)](https://kserve.github.io/website/modelserving/v1beta1/sklearn/v2/),
        where  MLServer is the core Python inference server used to serve machine
        learning  models.- Support for the standard [V2 Inference Protocol](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/reference/apis/v2-protocol.html)
        on  both the gRPC and REST flavours, which has been standardised and adopted
        by  various model serving frameworks.You can read more about the goals of
        this project on the [initial designdocument](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2uf4SaAtwLTlBCciOhvdiKQ2Eay4U72VxAD4bXe7iU/edit?usp=sharing).##
        UsageYou can install the `mlserver` package running:```bashpip install mlserver```Note
        that to use any of the optional [inference runtimes](#inference-runtimes),you'll
        need to install the relevant package.For example, to serve a `scikit-learn`
        model, you would need to install the`mlserver-sklearn` package:```bashpip
        install mlserver-sklearn```For further information on how to use MLServer,
        you can check any of the[available examples](#examples).## Inference RuntimesInference
        runtimes allow you to define how your model should be used withinMLServer.You
        can think of them as the **backend glue** between MLServer and your machinelearning
        framework of choice.You can read more about [inference runtimes in their documentationpage](./docs/runtimes/index.md).Out
        of the box, MLServer comes with a set of pre-packaged runtimes which letyou
        interact with a subset of common frameworks.This allows you to start serving
        models saved in these frameworks straightaway.However, it's also possible
        to **[write customruntimes](./docs/runtimes/custom.md)**.Out of the box, MLServer
        provides support for:| Framework     | Supported | Documentation                                                    ||

        Developer Guide### VersioningBoth the main `mlserver` package and the [inference
        runtimespackages](./docs/runtimes/index.md) try to follow the same versioning
        schema.To bump the version across all of them, you can use the[`./hack/update-version.sh`](./hack/update-version.sh)
        script.We generally keep the version as a placeholder for an upcoming version.For
        example:```bash./hack/update-version.sh 0.2.0.dev1```### TestingTo run all
        of the tests for MLServer and the runtimes, use:```bashmake test```To run
        run tests for a single file, use something like:```bashtox -e py3 -- tests/batch_processing/test_rest.py```"

        FrameworkOAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are
        severalprominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer
        from one orboth of the following:1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA
        RFC 5849.2. They predate the `OAuth 2.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 6749.3. They assume
        the usage of a specific HTTP request library... _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849..
        _`OAuth 2.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749OAuthLib is a framework
        which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 withoutassuming a specific
        HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuthclient support
        onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto yourfavourite web
        framework. If you''re a maintainer of such a library, write a thinveneer on
        top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.Documentation--------------Full

        [-a |--action=][install|requirements]This command install default instrumentation
        packages and detects active Python site-packagesto figure out which instrumentation
        packages the user might want to install. By default, itprints out a list of
        the default and detected instrumentation packages that can be added to arequirements.txt
        file. It also supports installing the packages when run with:code:`--action=install`
        or :code:`-a install` flag. All default and detectableinstrumentation packages
        are defined `here <https://github.com/flands/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/main/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/bootstrap_gen.py>`.opentelemetry-instrument------------------------::    opentelemetry-instrument
        python program.pyThe instrument command will try to automatically detect packages
        used by your python programand when possible, apply automatic tracing instrumentation
        on them. This means your programwill get automatic distributed tracing without
        having to make any code changes. This willalso configure a global tracer and
        tracing exporter as well as a meter and meter exporter.By default, the instrument
        command will use the OTLP exporter but this can be overridden.The command
        supports the following configuration options as CLI arguments and environmentvariables:*
        ``--traces_exporter`` or ``OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER``* ``--metrics_exporter``
        or ``OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER``* ``--distro`` or ``OTEL_PYTHON_DISTRO``* ``--configurator``
        or ``OTEL_PYTHON_CONFIGURATOR``The exporter options define what exporter destination
        to use and can be set to one or moreexporter names (see below). You can pass
        multiple values to configure multiple exporters(e.g., ``zipkin_json,otlp``).    -
        Defaults to `otlp`.    - Can be set to `none` to disable automatic tracer
        initialization.    - Can be set to ''console` to display JSON results locally.Trace
        exporter names:    - jaeger_proto    - jaeger_thrift    - opencensus    -
        otlp    - otlp_proto_grpc (`deprecated`)    - otlp_proto_http (`deprecated`)    -
        zipkin_json    - zipkin_protoMetric exporter names:    - otlp    - otlp_proto_grpc
        (`deprecated`)    - prometheusNote: The default transport protocol for ``otlp``
        is gRPC.* ``--id-generator`` or ``OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR``Used to specify
        which IDs Generator to use for the global Tracer Provider. By default, itwill
        use the random IDs generator.The code in ``program.py`` needs to use one of
        the packages for which there isan OpenTelemetry integration. For a list of
        the available integrations pleasecheck `here <https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#integrations>`_*
        ``OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS``If set by the user, opentelemetry-instrument
        will read this environment variable to disable specific instrumentations.e.g
        OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS = "requests,django"Examples^^^^^^^^::    opentelemetry-instrument
        --traces_exporter console flask run --port=3000The above command will pass
        ``--traces_exporter console`` to the instrument command and ``--port=3000``
        to ``flask run``.::    opentelemetry-instrument --traces_exporter zipkin_json,otlp
        celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=infoThe above command will configure global
        trace provider, attach zipkin and otlp exporters to it and thenstart celery
        with the rest of the arguments.::    opentelemetry-instrument --id_generator
        random flask run --port=3000The above command will configure the global trace
        provider to use the Random IDs Generator, and thenpass ``--port=3000`` to
        ``flask run``.References----------* `OpenTelemetry Project <https://opentelemetry.io/>`_'

        Einsum: A tensor contraction order optimizer======================================================Optimized
        einsum can significantly reduce the overall execution time of einsum-like
        expressions (e.g.,[`np.einsum`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html),[`dask.array.einsum`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.einsum),[`pytorch.einsum`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.einsum),[`tensorflow.einsum`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/einsum),)by
        optimizing the expression''s contraction order and dispatching manyoperations
        to canonical BLAS, cuBLAS, or other specialized routines. Optimizedeinsum
        is agnostic to the backend and can handle NumPy, Dask, PyTorch,Tensorflow,
        CuPy, Sparse, Theano, JAX, and Autograd arrays as well as potentiallyany library
        which conforms to a standard API. See the[**documentation**](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io)
        for moreinformation.## Example usageThe [`opt_einsum.contract`](https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autosummary/opt_einsum.contract.html#opt-einsum-contract)function
        can often act as a drop-in replacement for `einsum`functions without futher
        changes to the code while providing superior performance.Here, a tensor contraction
        is preformed with and without optimization:```pythonimport numpy as npfrom
        opt_einsum import contractN = 10C = np.random.rand(N, N)I = np.random.rand(N,
        N, N, N)%timeit np.einsum(''pi,qj,ijkl,rk,sl->pqrs'', C, C, I, C, C)1 loops,
        best of 3: 934 ms per loop%timeit contract(''pi,qj,ijkl,rk,sl->pqrs'', C,
        C, I, C, C)1000 loops, best of 3: 324 us per loop```In this particular example,
        we see a ~3000x performance improvement which isnot uncommon when compared
        against unoptimized contractions. See the [backendexamples](https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html)for
        more information on using other backends.## FeaturesThe algorithms found in
        this repository often power the `einsum` optimizationsin many of the above
        projects. For example, the optimization of `np.einsum`has been passed upstream
        and most of the same features that can be found inthis repository can be enabled
        with `np.einsum(..., optimize=True)`. However,this repository often has more
        up to date algorithms for complex contractions.The following capabilities
        are enabled by `opt_einsum`:* Inspect [detailed information](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/path_finding.html)
        about the path chosen.* Perform contractions with [numerous backends](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html),
        including on the GPU and with libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
        and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).* Generate [reusable expressions](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reusing_paths.html),
        potentially with [constant tensors](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reusing_paths.html#specifying-constants),
        that can be compiled for greater performance.* Use an arbitrary number of
        indices to find contractions for [hundreds or even thousands of tensors](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ex_large_expr_with_greedy.html).*
        Share [intermediate computations](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing_intermediates.html)
        among multiple contractions.* Compute gradients of tensor contractions using
        [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) or [jax](https://github.com/google/jax)Please
        see the [documentation](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        for more features!## Installation`opt_einsum` can either be installed via
        `pip install opt_einsum` or from conda `conda install opt_einsum -c conda-forge`.

        Usage### InstallTo install a wheel from PyPI:```shpip install --upgrade \"pip>=20.3\"
        # manylinux_x_y, universal2 wheel supportpip install --upgrade orjson```To
        build a wheel, see [packaging](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#packaging).###
        QuickstartThis is an example of serializing, with options specified, and deserializing:```python>>>
        import orjson, datetime, numpy>>> data = {    \"type\": \"job\",    \"created_at\":
        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1),    \"status\": \"\U0001F197\",    \"payload\":
        numpy.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]),}>>> orjson.dumps(data, option=orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC
        | orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY)b'{\"type\":\"job\",\"created_at\":\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\",\"status\":\"\\xf0\\x9f\\x86\\x97\",\"payload\":[[1,2],[3,4]]}'>>>
        orjson.loads(_){'type': 'job', 'created_at': '1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00',
        'status': '\U0001F197', 'payload': [[1, 2], [3, 4]]}```### Migratingorjson
        version 3 serializes more types than version 2. Subclasses of `str`,`int`,
        `dict`, and `list` are now serialized. This is faster and more similarto the
        standard library. It can be disabled with`orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS`.`dataclasses.dataclass`
        instancesare now serialized by default and cannot be customized in a`default`
        function unless `option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATACLASS` isspecified. `uuid.UUID`
        instances are serialized by default.For any type that is now serialized,implementations
        in a `default` function and options enabling them can beremoved but do not
        need to be. There was no change in deserialization.To migrate from the standard
        library, the largest difference is that`orjson.dumps` returns `bytes` and
        `json.dumps` returns a `str`. Users with`dict` objects using non-`str` keys
        should specify`option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS`. `sort_keys` is replaced by`option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS`.
        `indent` is replaced by`option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2` and other levels of indentation
        are notsupported.### Serialize```pythondef dumps(    __obj: Any,    default:
        Optional[Callable[[Any], Any]] = ...,    option: Optional[int] = ...,) ->
        bytes: ...````dumps()` serializes Python objects to JSON.It natively serializes`str`,
        `dict`, `list`, `tuple`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`,`dataclasses.dataclass`,
        `typing.TypedDict`, `datetime.datetime`,`datetime.date`, `datetime.time`,
        `uuid.UUID`, `numpy.ndarray`, and`orjson.Fragment` instances. It supports
        arbitrary types through `default`. Itserializes subclasses of `str`, `int`,
        `dict`, `list`,`dataclasses.dataclass`, and `enum.Enum`. It does not serialize
        subclassesof `tuple` to avoid serializing `namedtuple` objects as arrays.
        To avoidserializing subclasses, specify the option `orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS`.The
        output is a `bytes` object containing UTF-8.The global interpreter lock (GIL)
        is held for the duration of the call.It raises `JSONEncodeError` on an unsupported
        type. This exception messagedescribes the invalid object with the error message`Type
        is not JSON serializable: ...`. To fix this, specify[default](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#default).It
        raises `JSONEncodeError` on a `str` that contains invalid UTF-8.It raises
        `JSONEncodeError` on an integer that exceeds 64 bits by default or,with `OPT_STRICT_INTEGER`,
        53 bits.It raises `JSONEncodeError` if a `dict` has a key of a type other
        than `str`,unless `OPT_NON_STR_KEYS` is specified.It raises `JSONEncodeError`
        if the output of `default` recurses to handling by`default` more than 254
        levels deep.It raises `JSONEncodeError` on circular references.It raises `JSONEncodeError`
        \ if a `tzinfo` on a datetime object isunsupported.`JSONEncodeError` is a
        subclass of `TypeError`. This is for compatibilitywith the standard library.If
        the failure was caused by an exception in `default` then`JSONEncodeError`
        chains the original exception as `__cause__`.#### defaultTo serialize a subclass
        or arbitrary types, specify `default` as acallable that returns a supported
        type. `default` may be a function,lambda, or callable class instance. To specify
        that a type was nothandled by `default`, raise an exception such as `TypeError`.```python>>>
        import orjson, decimal>>>def default(obj):    if isinstance(obj, decimal.Decimal):
        \       return str(obj)    raise TypeError>>> orjson.dumps(decimal.Decimal(\"0.0842389659712649442845\"))JSONEncodeError:
        Type is not JSON serializable: decimal.Decimal>>> orjson.dumps(decimal.Decimal(\"0.0842389659712649442845\"),
        default=default)b'\"0.0842389659712649442845\"'>>> orjson.dumps({1, 2}, default=default)orjson.JSONEncodeError:
        Type is not JSON serializable: set```The `default` callable may return an
        object that itselfmust be handled by `default` up to 254 times before an exceptionis
        raised.It is important that `default` raise an exception if a type cannot
        be handled.Python otherwise implicitly returns `None`, which appears to the
        callerlike a legitimate value and is serialized:```python>>> import orjson,
        json, rapidjson>>>def default(obj):    if isinstance(obj, decimal.Decimal):
        \       return str(obj)>>> orjson.dumps({\"set\":{1, 2}}, default=default)b'{\"set\":null}'>>>
        json.dumps({\"set\":{1, 2}}, default=default)'{\"set\":null}'>>> rapidjson.dumps({\"set\":{1,
        2}}, default=default)'{\"set\":null}'```#### optionTo modify how data is serialized,
        specify `option`. Each `option` is an integerconstant in `orjson`. To specify
        multiple options, mask them together, e.g.,`option=orjson.OPT_STRICT_INTEGER
        | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC`.##### OPT_APPEND_NEWLINEAppend `\\n` to the output.
        This is a convenience and optimization for thepattern of `dumps(...) + \"\\n\"`.
        `bytes` objects are immutable and thispattern copies the original contents.```python>>>
        import orjson>>> orjson.dumps([])b\"[]\">>> orjson.dumps([], option=orjson.OPT_APPEND_NEWLINE)b\"[]\\n\"```#####
        OPT_INDENT_2Pretty-print output with an indent of two spaces. This is equivalent
        to`indent=2` in the standard library. Pretty printing is slower and the outputlarger.
        orjson is the fastest compared library at pretty printing and hasmuch less
        of a slowdown to pretty print than the standard library does. Thisoption is
        compatible with all other options.```python>>> import orjson>>> orjson.dumps({\"a\":
        \"b\", \"c\": {\"d\": True}, \"e\": [1, 2]})b'{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":{\"d\":true},\"e\":[1,2]}'>>>
        orjson.dumps(    {\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": {\"d\": True}, \"e\": [1, 2]},    option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2)b'{\\n
        \ \"a\": \"b\",\\n  \"c\": {\\n    \"d\": true\\n  },\\n  \"e\": [\\n    1,\\n
        \   2\\n  ]\\n}'```If displayed, the indentation and linebreaks appear like
        this:```json{  \"a\": \"b\",  \"c\": {    \"d\": true  },  \"e\": [    1,
        \   2  ]}```This measures serializing the github.json fixture as compact (52KiB)
        orpretty (64KiB):| Library    |   compact (ms) |   pretty (ms) |   vs. orjson

        serializing the citm_catalog.json fixture, more of a worstcase due to the

        |This can be reproduced using the `pyindent` script.##### OPT_NAIVE_UTCSerialize
        `datetime.datetime` objects without a `tzinfo` as UTC. Thishas no effect on
        `datetime.datetime` objects that have `tzinfo` set.```python>>> import orjson,
        datetime>>> orjson.dumps(        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),    )b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"'>>>
        orjson.dumps(        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),        option=orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC,
        \   )b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'```##### OPT_NON_STR_KEYSSerialize `dict`
        keys of type other than `str`. This allows `dict` keysto be one of `str`,
        `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`, `datetime.datetime`,`datetime.date`, `datetime.time`,
        `enum.Enum`, and `uuid.UUID`. For comparison,the standard library serializes
        `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` or `None` bydefault. orjson benchmarks as being
        faster at serializing non-`str` keysthan other libraries. This option is slower
        for `str` keys than the default.```python>>> import orjson, datetime, uuid>>>
        orjson.dumps(        {uuid.UUID(\"7202d115-7ff3-4c81-a7c1-2a1f067b1ece\"):
        [1, 2, 3]},        option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS,    )b'{\"7202d115-7ff3-4c81-a7c1-2a1f067b1ece\":[1,2,3]}'>>>
        orjson.dumps(        {datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0): [1, 2, 3]},
        \       option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC,    )b'{\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\":[1,2,3]}'```These
        types are generally serialized how they would be asvalues, e.g., `datetime.datetime`
        is still an RFC 3339 string and respectsoptions affecting it. The exception
        is that `int` serialization does notrespect `OPT_STRICT_INTEGER`.This option
        has the risk of creating duplicate keys. This is because non-`str`objects
        may serialize to the same `str` as an existing key, e.g.,`{\"1\": true, 1:
        false}`. The last key to be inserted to the `dict` will beserialized last
        and a JSON deserializer will presumably take the lastoccurrence of a key (in
        the above, `false`). The first value will be lost.This option is compatible
        with `orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS`. If sorting is used,note the sort is unstable
        and will be unpredictable for duplicate keys.```python>>> import orjson, datetime>>>
        orjson.dumps(    {\"other\": 1, datetime.date(1970, 1, 5): 2, datetime.date(1970,
        1, 3): 3},    option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS | orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)b'{\"1970-01-03\":3,\"1970-01-05\":2,\"other\":1}'```This
        measures serializing 589KiB of JSON comprising a `list` of 100 `dict`in which
        each `dict` has both 365 randomly-sorted `int` keys representing epochtimestamps
        as well as one `str` key and the value for each key is asingle integer. In
        \"str keys\", the keys were converted to `str` beforeserialization, and orjson
        still specifes `option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS`(which is always somewhat slower).|

        is blank for sorting because it segfaults. json is blank because itraises
        `TypeError` on attempting to sort before converting all keys to `str`.rapidjson
        is blank because it does not support non-`str` keys. This canbe reproduced
        using the `pynonstr` script.##### OPT_OMIT_MICROSECONDSDo not serialize the
        `microsecond` field on `datetime.datetime` and`datetime.time` instances.```python>>>
        import orjson, datetime>>> orjson.dumps(        datetime.datetime(1970, 1,
        1, 0, 0, 0, 1),    )b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000001\"'>>> orjson.dumps(        datetime.datetime(1970,

        OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATACLASSPassthrough `dataclasses.dataclass` instances to
        `default`. This allowscustomizing their output but is much slower.```python>>>
        import orjson, dataclasses>>>@dataclasses.dataclassclass User:    id: str
        \   name: str    password: strdef default(obj):    if isinstance(obj, User):
        \       return {\"id\": obj.id, \"name\": obj.name}    raise TypeError>>>

        \   )b'{\"id\":\"3b1\",\"name\":\"asd\"}'```##### OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIMEPassthrough
        `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.date`, and `datetime.time` instancesto `default`.
        This allows serializing datetimes to a custom format, e.g.,HTTP dates:```python>>>
        import orjson, datetime>>>def default(obj):    if isinstance(obj, datetime.datetime):
        \       return obj.strftime(\"%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT\")    raise TypeError>>>
        orjson.dumps({\"created_at\": datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)})b'{\"created_at\":\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"}'>>>
        orjson.dumps({\"created_at\": datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)}, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME)TypeError:
        Type is not JSON serializable: datetime.datetime>>> orjson.dumps(        {\"created_at\":
        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)},        option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME,
        \       default=default,    )b'{\"created_at\":\"Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00
        GMT\"}'```This does not affect datetimes in `dict` keys if using OPT_NON_STR_KEYS.#####
        OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASSPassthrough subclasses of builtin types to `default`.```python>>>
        import orjson>>>class Secret(str):    passdef default(obj):    if isinstance(obj,
        Secret):        return \"******\"    raise TypeError>>> orjson.dumps(Secret(\"zxc\"))b'\"zxc\"'>>>
        orjson.dumps(Secret(\"zxc\"), option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)TypeError:
        Type is not JSON serializable: Secret>>> orjson.dumps(Secret(\"zxc\"), option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS,
        default=default)b'\"******\"'```This does not affect serializing subclasses
        as `dict` keys if usingOPT_NON_STR_KEYS.##### OPT_SERIALIZE_DATACLASSThis
        is deprecated and has no effect in version 3. In version 2 this wasrequired
        to serialize  `dataclasses.dataclass` instances. For more, see[dataclass](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#dataclass).#####
        OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPYSerialize `numpy.ndarray` instances. For more, see[numpy](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#numpy).#####
        OPT_SERIALIZE_UUIDThis is deprecated and has no effect in version 3. In version
        2 this wasrequired to serialize `uuid.UUID` instances. For more, see[UUID](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#UUID).#####
        OPT_SORT_KEYSSerialize `dict` keys in sorted order. The default is to serialize
        in anunspecified order. This is equivalent to `sort_keys=True` in the standardlibrary.This
        can be used to ensure the order is deterministic for hashing or tests.It has
        a substantial performance penalty and is not recommended in general.```python>>>
        import orjson>>> orjson.dumps({\"b\": 1, \"c\": 2, \"a\": 3})b'{\"b\":1,\"c\":2,\"a\":3}'>>>
        orjson.dumps({\"b\": 1, \"c\": 2, \"a\": 3}, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)b'{\"a\":3,\"b\":1,\"c\":2}'```This
        measures serializing the twitter.json fixture unsorted and sorted:| Library

        |The benchmark can be reproduced using the `pysort` script.The sorting is
        not collation/locale-aware:```python>>> import orjson>>> orjson.dumps({\"a\":
        1, \"\xE4\": 2, \"A\": 3}, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)b'{\"A\":3,\"a\":1,\"\\xc3\\xa4\":2}'```This
        is the same sorting behavior as the standard library, rapidjson,simplejson,
        and ujson.`dataclass` also serialize as maps but this has no effect on them.#####
        OPT_STRICT_INTEGEREnforce 53-bit limit on integers. The limit is otherwise
        64 bits, the same asthe Python standard library. For more, see [int](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#int).#####
        OPT_UTC_ZSerialize a UTC timezone on `datetime.datetime` instances as `Z`
        insteadof `+00:00`.```python>>> import orjson, datetime, zoneinfo>>> orjson.dumps(
        \       datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\")),
        \   )b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'>>> orjson.dumps(        datetime.datetime(1970,
        1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\")),        option=orjson.OPT_UTC_Z
        \   )b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\"'```#### Fragment`orjson.Fragment` includes
        already-serialized JSON in a document. This is anefficient way to include
        JSON blobs from a cache, JSONB field, or separatelyserialized object without
        first deserializing to Python objects via `loads()`.```python>>> import orjson>>>
        orjson.dumps({\"key\": \"zxc\", \"data\": orjson.Fragment(b'{\"a\": \"b\",
        \"c\": 1}')})b'{\"key\":\"zxc\",\"data\":{\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": 1}}'```It does
        no reformatting: `orjson.OPT_INDENT_2` will not affect acompact blob nor will
        a pretty-printed JSON blob be rewritten as compact.The input must be `bytes`
        or `str` and given as a positional argument.This raises `orjson.JSONEncodeError`
        if a `str` is given and the input isnot valid UTF-8. It otherwise does no
        validation and it is possible towrite invalid JSON. This does not escape characters.
        The implementation istested to not crash if given invalid strings or invalid
        JSON.This is similar to `RawJSON` in rapidjson.### Deserialize```pythondef
        loads(__obj: Union[bytes, bytearray, memoryview, str]) -> Any: ...````loads()`
        deserializes JSON to Python objects. It deserializes to `dict`,`list`, `int`,
        `float`, `str`, `bool`, and `None` objects.`bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`,
        and `str` input are accepted. If the inputexists as a `memoryview`, `bytearray`,
        or `bytes` object, it is recommended topass these directly rather than creating
        an unnecessary `str` object. That is,`orjson.loads(b\"{}\")` instead of `orjson.loads(b\"{}\".decode(\"utf-8\"))`.
        Thishas lower memory usage and lower latency.The input must be valid UTF-8.orjson
        maintains a cache of map keys for the duration of the process. Thiscauses
        a net reduction in memory usage by avoiding duplicate strings. Thekeys must
        be at most 64 bytes to be cached and 1024 entries are stored.The global interpreter
        lock (GIL) is held for the duration of the call.It raises `JSONDecodeError`
        if given an invalid type or invalidJSON. This includes if the input contains
        `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `-Infinity`,which the standard library allows, but is
        not valid JSON.It raises `JSONDecodeError` if a combination of array or object
        recurses1024 levels deep.`JSONDecodeError` is a subclass of `json.JSONDecodeError`
        and `ValueError`.This is for compatibility with the standard library.## Types###
        dataclassorjson serializes instances of `dataclasses.dataclass` natively.
        It serializesinstances 40-50x as fast as other libraries and avoids a severe
        slowdown seenin other libraries compared to serializing `dict`.It is supported
        to pass all variants of dataclasses, including dataclassesusing `__slots__`,
        frozen dataclasses, those with optional or defaultattributes, and subclasses.
        There is a performance benefit to notusing `__slots__`.| Library    | dict

        measures serializing 555KiB of JSON, orjson natively and other librariesusing
        `default` to serialize the output of `dataclasses.asdict()`. This can bereproduced
        using the `pydataclass` script.Dataclasses are serialized as maps, with every
        attribute serialized and inthe order given on class definition:```python>>>
        import dataclasses, orjson, typing@dataclasses.dataclassclass Member:    id:
        int    active: bool = dataclasses.field(default=False)@dataclasses.dataclassclass
        Object:    id: int    name: str    members: typing.List[Member]>>> orjson.dumps(Object(1,
        \"a\", [Member(1, True), Member(2)]))b'{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"a\",\"members\":[{\"id\":1,\"active\":true},{\"id\":2,\"active\":false}]}'```###
        datetimeorjson serializes `datetime.datetime` objects to[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)
        format,e.g., \"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\". This is a subset of ISO 8601 and
        iscompatible with `isoformat()` in the standard library.```python>>> import
        orjson, datetime, zoneinfo>>> orjson.dumps(    datetime.datetime(2018, 12,
        1, 2, 3, 4, 9, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"Australia/Adelaide\")))b'\"2018-12-01T02:03:04.000009+10:30\"'>>>
        orjson.dumps(    datetime.datetime(2100, 9, 1, 21, 55, 2).replace(tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\")))b'\"2100-09-01T21:55:02+00:00\"'>>>
        orjson.dumps(    datetime.datetime(2100, 9, 1, 21, 55, 2))b'\"2100-09-01T21:55:02\"'````datetime.datetime`
        supports instances with a `tzinfo` that is `None`,`datetime.timezone.utc`,
        a timezone instance from the python3.9+ `zoneinfo`module, or a timezone instance
        from the third-party `pendulum`, `pytz`, or`dateutil`/`arrow` libraries.It
        is fastest to use the standard library's `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo` for timezones.`datetime.time`
        objects must not have a `tzinfo`.```python>>> import orjson, datetime>>> orjson.dumps(datetime.time(12,
        0, 15, 290))b'\"12:00:15.000290\"'````datetime.date` objects will always serialize.```python>>>
        import orjson, datetime>>> orjson.dumps(datetime.date(1900, 1, 2))b'\"1900-01-02\"'```Errors
        with `tzinfo` result in `JSONEncodeError` being raised.To disable serialization
        of `datetime` objects specify the option`orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME`.To
        use \"Z\" suffix instead of \"+00:00\" to indicate UTC (\"Zulu\") time, use
        the option`orjson.OPT_UTC_Z`.To assume datetimes without timezone are UTC,
        use the option `orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC`.### enumorjson serializes enums natively.
        Options apply to their values.```python>>> import enum, datetime, orjson>>>class
        DatetimeEnum(enum.Enum):    EPOCH = datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)>>>
        orjson.dumps(DatetimeEnum.EPOCH)b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"'>>> orjson.dumps(DatetimeEnum.EPOCH,
        option=orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC)b'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'```Enums with
        members that are not supported types can be serialized using`default`:```python>>>
        import enum, orjson>>>class Custom:    def __init__(self, val):        self.val
        = valdef default(obj):    if isinstance(obj, Custom):        return obj.val
        \   raise TypeErrorclass CustomEnum(enum.Enum):    ONE = Custom(1)>>> orjson.dumps(CustomEnum.ONE,
        default=default)b'1'```### floatorjson serializes and deserializes double
        precision floats with no loss ofprecision and consistent rounding.`orjson.dumps()`
        serializes Nan, Infinity, and -Infinity, which are notcompliant JSON, as `null`:```python>>>
        import orjson, ujson, rapidjson, json>>> orjson.dumps([float(\"NaN\"), float(\"Infinity\"),
        float(\"-Infinity\")])b'[null,null,null]'>>> ujson.dumps([float(\"NaN\"),
        float(\"Infinity\"), float(\"-Infinity\")])OverflowError: Invalid Inf value
        when encoding double>>> rapidjson.dumps([float(\"NaN\"), float(\"Infinity\"),
        float(\"-Infinity\")])'[NaN,Infinity,-Infinity]'>>> json.dumps([float(\"NaN\"),
        float(\"Infinity\"), float(\"-Infinity\")])'[NaN, Infinity, -Infinity]'```###
        intorjson serializes and deserializes 64-bit integers by default. The rangesupported
        is a signed 64-bit integer's minimum (-9223372036854775807) toan unsigned
        64-bit integer's maximum (18446744073709551615). Thisis widely compatible,
        but there are implementationsthat only support 53-bits for integers, e.g.,web
        browsers. For those implementations, `dumps()` can be configured toraise a
        `JSONEncodeError` on values exceeding the 53-bit range.```python>>> import
        orjson>>> orjson.dumps(9007199254740992)b'9007199254740992'>>> orjson.dumps(9007199254740992,
        option=orjson.OPT_STRICT_INTEGER)JSONEncodeError: Integer exceeds 53-bit range>>>
        orjson.dumps(-9007199254740992, option=orjson.OPT_STRICT_INTEGER)JSONEncodeError:
        Integer exceeds 53-bit range```### numpyorjson natively serializes `numpy.ndarray`
        and individual`numpy.float64`, `numpy.float32`, `numpy.float16` (`numpy.half`),`numpy.int64`,
        `numpy.int32`, `numpy.int16`, `numpy.int8`,`numpy.uint64`, `numpy.uint32`,
        `numpy.uint16`, `numpy.uint8`,`numpy.uintp`, `numpy.intp`, `numpy.datetime64`,
        and `numpy.bool`instances.orjson is faster than all compared libraries at
        serializingnumpy instances. Serializing numpy data requires specifying`option=orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY`.```python>>>
        import orjson, numpy>>> orjson.dumps(        numpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5,
        6]]),        option=orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY,)b'[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]'```The
        array must be a contiguous C array (`C_CONTIGUOUS`) and one of thesupported
        datatypes.Note a difference between serializing `numpy.float32` using `ndarray.tolist()`or
        `orjson.dumps(..., option=orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY)`: `tolist()` convertsto
        a `double` before serializing and orjson's native path does not. Thiscan result
        in different rounding.`numpy.datetime64` instances are serialized as RFC 3339
        strings anddatetime options affect them.```python>>> import orjson, numpy>>>
        orjson.dumps(        numpy.datetime64(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.172\"),        option=orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY,)b'\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.172000\"'>>>
        orjson.dumps(        numpy.datetime64(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.172\"),        option=(
        \           orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY |            orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC |
        \           orjson.OPT_OMIT_MICROSECONDS        ),)b'\"2021-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'```If
        an array is not a contiguous C array, contains an unsupported datatype,or
        contains a `numpy.datetime64` using an unsupported representation(e.g., picoseconds),
        orjson falls through to `default`. In `default`,`obj.tolist()` can be specified.If
        an array is not in the native endianness, e.g., an array of big-endian valueson
        a little-endian system, `orjson.JSONEncodeError`  is raised.If an array is
        malformed, `orjson.JSONEncodeError` is raised.This measures serializing 92MiB
        of JSON from an `numpy.ndarray` withdimensions of `(50000, 100)` and `numpy.float64`

        these benchmarks, orjson serializes natively, ujson is blank because itdoes
        not support a `default` parameter, and the other libraries serialize`ndarray.tolist()`
        via `default`. The RSS column measures peak memoryusage during serialization.
        This can be reproduced using the `pynumpy` script.orjson does not have an
        installation or compilation dependency on numpy. Theimplementation is independent,
        reading `numpy.ndarray` using`PyArrayInterface`.### strorjson is strict about
        UTF-8 conformance. This is stricter than the standardlibrary's json module,
        which will serialize and deserialize UTF-16 surrogates,e.g., \"\\ud800\",
        that are invalid UTF-8.If `orjson.dumps()` is given a `str` that does not
        contain valid UTF-8,`orjson.JSONEncodeError` is raised. If `loads()` receives
        invalid UTF-8,`orjson.JSONDecodeError` is raised.orjson and rapidjson are
        the only compared JSON libraries to consistentlyerror on bad input.```python>>>
        import orjson, ujson, rapidjson, json>>> orjson.dumps('\\ud800')JSONEncodeError:
        str is not valid UTF-8: surrogates not allowed>>> ujson.dumps('\\ud800')UnicodeEncodeError:
        'utf-8' codec ...>>> rapidjson.dumps('\\ud800')UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8'
        codec ...>>> json.dumps('\\ud800')'\"\\\\ud800\"'>>> orjson.loads('\"\\\\ud800\"')JSONDecodeError:
        unexpected end of hex escape at line 1 column 8: line 1 column 1 (char 0)>>>
        ujson.loads('\"\\\\ud800\"')''>>> rapidjson.loads('\"\\\\ud800\"')ValueError:
        Parse error at offset 1: The surrogate pair in string is invalid.>>> json.loads('\"\\\\ud800\"')'\\ud800'```To
        make a best effort at deserializing bad input, first decode `bytes` usingthe
        `replace` or `lossy` argument for `errors`:```python>>> import orjson>>> orjson.loads(b'\"\\xed\\xa0\\x80\"')JSONDecodeError:
        str is not valid UTF-8: surrogates not allowed>>> orjson.loads(b'\"\\xed\\xa0\\x80\"'.decode(\"utf-8\",
        \"replace\"))'\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD'```### uuidorjson serializes `uuid.UUID`
        instances to[RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) format, e.g.,\"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\".```
        python>>> import orjson, uuid>>> orjson.dumps(uuid.UUID('f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'))b'\"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\"'>>>

        TestingThe library has comprehensive tests. There are tests against fixtures
        in the[JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite) and[nativejson-benchmark](https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark)repositories.
        It is tested to not crash against the[Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings).It
        is tested to not leak memory. It is tested to not crashagainst and not accept
        invalid UTF-8. There are integration testsexercising the library's use in
        web servers (gunicorn using multiprocess/forkedworkers) and whenmultithreaded.
        It also uses some tests from the ultrajson library.orjson is the most correct
        of the compared libraries. This graph shows how eachlibrary handles a combined

        |This shows that all libraries deserialize valid JSON but only orjsoncorrectly
        rejects the given invalid JSON fixtures. Errors are largely due toaccepting

        usage than other librariesdue to a persistent buffer used for parsing. Incremental
        memory usage whendeserializing is similar to the standard library and other
        third-partylibraries.This measures, in the first column, RSS after importing
        a library and readingthe fixture, and in the second column, increases in RSS
        after repeatedlycalling `loads()` on the fixture.#### twitter.json| Library

        |### ReproducingThe above was measured using Python 3.11.8 on Linux (amd64)
        withorjson 3.10.0, ujson 5.9.0, python-rapidson 1.16, and simplejson 3.19.2.The
        latency results can be reproduced using the `pybench` and `graph`scripts.
        The memory results can be reproduced using the `pymem` script.## Questions###
        Why can't I install it from PyPI?Probably `pip` needs to be upgraded to version
        20.3 or later to supportthe latest manylinux_x_y or universal2 wheel formats.###
        \"Cargo, the Rust package manager, is not installed or is not on PATH.\"This
        happens when there are no binary wheels (like manylinux) for yourplatform
        on PyPI. You can install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) through`rustup`
        or a package manager and then it will compile.### Will it deserialize to dataclasses,
        UUIDs, decimals, etc or support object_hook?No. This requires a schema specifying
        what types are expected and how tohandle errors etc. This is addressed by
        data validation libraries alevel above this.### Will it serialize to `str`?No.
        `bytes` is the correct type for a serialized blob.## PackagingTo package orjson
        requires at least [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.72and the [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin)
        build tool. The recommendedbuild command is:```shmaturin build --release --strip```It
        benefits from also having a C build environment to compile a fasterdeserialization
        backend. See this project's `manylinux_2_28` builds for anexample using clang
        and LTO.The project's own CI tests against `nightly-2024-04-15` and stable
        1.72. Itis prudent to pin the nightly version because that channel can introducebreaking
        changes.orjson is tested for amd64, aarch64, arm7, ppc64le, and s390x on Linux.
        Itis tested for either aarch64 or amd64 on macOS and cross-compiles for the
        other,depending on version. For Windows it is tested on amd64 and i686.There
        are no runtime dependencies other than libc.The source distribution on PyPI
        contains all dependencies' source and can bebuilt without network access.
        The file can be downloaded from`https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/o/orjson/orjson-${version}.tar.gz`.orjson's
        tests are included in the source distribution on PyPI. Therequirements to
        run the tests are specified in `test/requirements.txt`. Thetests should be
        run as part of the build. It can be run with`pytest -q test`.## Licenseorjson

        What is it?**pandas** is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and
        expressive datastructures designed to make working with \"relational\" or
        \"labeled\" data botheasy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level
        building block fordoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python.
        Additionally, it hasthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible
        open source dataanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**.
        It is already well onits way towards this goal.## Main FeaturesHere are just
        a few of the things that pandas does well:  - Easy handling of [**missing
        data**][missing-data] (represented as    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating
        point as well as non-floating point data  - Size mutability: columns can be
        [**inserted and    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher
        dimensional    objects  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]:
        objects can    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
        \   ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically    align
        the data for you in computations  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby]
        functionality to perform    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for
        both aggregating    and transforming data  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion]
        ragged,    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures
        \   into DataFrame objects  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing],
        [**fancy    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting]
        of    large data sets  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining]
        data    sets  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table]
        of    data sets  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have
        multiple    labels per tick)  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat
        files**][flat-files]    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],
        \   and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]
        \ - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range    generation
        and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,    date shifting and lagging

      Description: '# py-grpc-prometheusInstrument library to provide prometheus metrics
        similar to:- https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/java-grpc-prometheus- https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus##
        StatusCurrently, the library has the parity metrics with the Java and Go library.###
        Server side:- grpc_server_started_total- grpc_server_handled_total- grpc_server_msg_received_total-
        grpc_server_msg_sent_total- grpc_server_handling_seconds### Client side:-
        grpc_client_started_total- grpc_client_handled_total- grpc_client_msg_received_total-
        grpc_client_msg_sent_total- grpc_client_handling_seconds- grpc_client_msg_recv_handling_seconds-
        grpc_client_msg_send_handling_seconds## How to use```pip install py-grpc-prometheus```##
        Client side:Client metrics monitoring is done by intercepting the gPRC channel.```pythonimport
        grpcfrom py_grpc_prometheus.prometheus_client_interceptor import PromClientInterceptorchannel
        = grpc.intercept_channel(grpc.insecure_channel(''server:6565''),                                         PromClientInterceptor())#
        Start an end point to expose metrics.start_http_server(metrics_port)```##
        Server side:Server metrics are exposed by adding the interceptor when the
        gRPC server is started. Take a look at`tests/integration/hello_world/hello_world_client.py`
        for the complete example.```pythonimport grpcfrom concurrent import futuresfrom
        py_grpc_prometheus.prometheus_server_interceptor import PromServerInterceptorfrom
        prometheus_client import start_http_server```Start the gRPC server with the
        interceptor, take a look at`tests/integration/hello_world/hello_world_server.py`
        for the complete example.```pythonserver = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10),                         interceptors=(PromServerInterceptor(),))#
        Start an end point to expose metrics.start_http_server(metrics_port)```##
        Histograms[Prometheus histograms](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)
        are a great wayto measure latency distributions of your RPCs. However, since
        it is bad practice to have metricsof [high cardinality](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/#do-not-overuse-labels)the
        latency monitoring metrics are disabled by default. To enable them please
        call the followingin your interceptor initialization code:```jsoniqserver
        = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10),                     interceptors=(PromServerInterceptor(enable_handling_time_histogram=True),))```After
        the call completes, its handling time will be recorded in a [Prometheus histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)variable
        `grpc_server_handling_seconds`. The histogram variable contains three sub-metrics:
        * `grpc_server_handling_seconds_count` - the count of all completed RPCs by
        status and method * `grpc_server_handling_seconds_sum` - cumulative time of
        RPCs by status and method, useful for   calculating average handling times
        * `grpc_server_handling_seconds_bucket` - contains the counts of RPCs by status
        and method in respective   handling-time buckets. These buckets can be used
        by Prometheus to estimate SLAs (see [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/))##
        Server Side:- enable_handling_time_histogram: Enables ''grpc_server_handling_seconds''##
        Client Side:- enable_client_handling_time_histogram: Enables ''grpc_client_handling_seconds''-
        enable_client_stream_receive_time_histogram: Enables ''grpc_client_msg_recv_handling_seconds''-
        enable_client_stream_send_time_histogram: Enables ''grpc_client_msg_send_handling_seconds''##
        Legacy metrics:Metric names have been updated to be in line with those from
        https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus.The legacy metrics are:###
        server side:- grpc_server_started_total- grpc_server_handled_total- grpc_server_handled_latency_seconds-
        grpc_server_msg_received_total- grpc_server_msg_sent_total### client side:-
        grpc_client_started_total- grpc_client_completed- grpc_client_completed_latency_seconds-
        grpc_client_msg_sent_total- grpc_client_msg_received_totalIn order to be able
        to use these legacy metrics for backwards compatibility, the `legacy` flag
        can be set to `True` when initialising the server/client interceptorsFor example,
        to enable the server side legacy metrics:```jsoniqserver = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10),                     interceptors=(PromServerInterceptor(legacy=True),))```##
        How to run and test```shmake initialize-developmentmake test```## TODO:- Unit

        using pyasn1----------------ASN.1 solves the data serialisation problem. This
        solution wasdesigned long ago by the wise Ancients. Back then, they did nothave
        the luxury of wasting bits. That is why ASN.1 is designedto serialise data
        structures of unbounded complexity intosomething compact and efficient when
        it comes to processingthe data.That probably explains why many network protocols
        and file formatsstill rely on the 30+ years old technology. Including a number
        ofhigh-profile Internet protocols and file formats.Quite a number of books
        cover the topic of ASN.1. [Communication between heterogeneous systems](http://www.oss.com/asn1/dubuisson.html)by
        Olivier Dubuisson is one of those high quality books freely available on the
        Internet.The pyasn1 package is designed to help Python programmers tacklingnetwork
        protocols and file formats at the comfort of their Pythonprompt. The tool
        struggles to capture all aspects of a rathercomplicated ASN.1 system and to
        represent it on the Python terms.How to use pyasn1-----------------With pyasn1
        you can build Python objects from ASN.1 data structures.For example, the following
        ASN.1 data structure:```bashRecord ::= SEQUENCE {  id        INTEGER,  room  [0]
        INTEGER OPTIONAL,  house [1] INTEGER DEFAULT 0}```Could be expressed in pyasn1
        like this:```pythonclass Record(Sequence):    componentType = NamedTypes(        NamedType(''id'',
        Integer()),        OptionalNamedType(            ''room'', Integer().subtype(                implicitTag=Tag(tagClassContext,
        tagFormatSimple, 0)            )        ),        DefaultedNamedType(            ''house'',
        Integer(0).subtype(                implicitTag=Tag(tagClassContext, tagFormatSimple,
        1)            )        )    )```It is in the spirit of ASN.1 to take abstract
        data description and turn it into a programming language specific form.Once
        you have your ASN.1 data structure expressed in Python, youcan use it along
        the lines of similar Python type (e.g. ASN.1`SET` is similar to Python `dict`,
        `SET OF` to `list`):```python>>> record = Record()>>> record[''id''] = 123>>>
        record[''room''] = 321>>> str(record)Record: id=123 room=321>>>```Part of
        the power of ASN.1 comes from its serialisation features. Youcan serialise
        your data structure and send it over the network.```python>>> from pyasn1.codec.der.encoder
        import encode>>> substrate = encode(record)>>> hexdump(substrate)00000: 30
        07 02 01 7B 80 02 01 41```Conversely, you can turn serialised ASN.1 content,
        as received fromnetwork or read from a file, into a Python object which you
        canintrospect, modify, encode and send back.```python>>> from pyasn1.codec.der.decoder
        import decode>>> received_record, rest_of_substrate = decode(substrate, asn1Spec=Record())>>>>>>
        for field in received_record:>>>    print(''{} is {}''.format(field, received_record[field]))id
        is 123room is 321house is 0>>>>>> record == received_recordTrue>>> received_record.update(room=123)>>>
        substrate = encode(received_record)>>> hexdump(substrate)00000: 30 06 02 01
        7B 80 01 7B```The pyasn1 classes struggle to emulate their Python prototypes
        (e.g. int,list, dict etc.). But ASN.1 types exhibit more complicated behaviour.To
        make life easier for a Pythonista, they can turn their pyasn1classes into
        Python built-ins:```python>>> from pyasn1.codec.native.encoder import encode>>>
        encode(record){''id'': 123, ''room'': 321, ''house'': 0}```Or vice-versa --
        you can initialize an ASN.1 structure from a tree ofPython objects:```python>>>
        from pyasn1.codec.native.decoder import decode>>> record = decode({''id'':
        123, ''room'': 321, ''house'': 0}, asn1Spec=Record())>>> str(record)Record:
        id=123 room=321>>>```With ASN.1 design, serialisation codecs are decoupled
        from data objects,so you could turn every single ASN.1 object into many different
        serialised forms. As of this moment, pyasn1 supports BER, DER, CER andPython
        built-ins codecs. The extremely compact PER encoding is expectedto be introduced
        in the upcoming pyasn1 release.More information on pyasn1 APIs can be found
        in the[documentation](https://pyasn1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyasn1/contents.html),compiled

        Pydantic V1.10 vs. V2Pydantic V2 is a ground-up rewrite that offers many new
        features, performance improvements, and some breaking changes compared to
        Pydantic V1.If you're using Pydantic V1 you may want to look at the[pydantic
        V1.10 Documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or,[`1.10.X-fixes` git branch](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tree/1.10.X-fixes).
        Pydantic V2 also ships with the latest version of Pydantic V1 built in so
        that you can incrementally upgrade your code base and projects: `from pydantic
        import v1 as pydantic_v1`.## HelpSee [documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
        for more details.## InstallationInstall using `pip install -U pydantic` or
        `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.For more installation options to make
        Pydantic even faster,see the [Install](https://docs.pydantic.dev/install/)
        section in the documentation.## A Simple Example```pyfrom datetime import

        to give an idea about the power of thepackage. For more examples, look at
        the documentation.Suppose you want to know how much time is left, inyears/months/days/etc,
        before the next easter happening on ayear with a Friday 13th in August, and
        you want to get today'sdate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here
        is the code:.. code-block:: python3    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import
        *    >>> from dateutil.easter import *    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *
        \   >>> from dateutil.parser import *    >>> from datetime import *    >>>
        now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")    >>> today = now.date()    >>>
        year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year
        \   >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)    >>> print(\"Today is:
        %s\" % today)    Today is: 2003-10-11    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th
        on a Friday is: %s\" % year)    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004
        \   >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)    How
        far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)    >>> print(\"And
        the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))    And the Easter of that
        year is: 2004-04-11Being exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence

      Description: "# python-dotenv[![Build Status][build_status_badge]][build_status_link][![PyPI

        `.env` file and can set them as environmentvariables. It helps in the development
        of applications following the[12-factor](https://12factor.net/) principles.-

        expansion](#variable-expansion)- [Related Projects](#related-projects)- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)##
        Getting Started```shellpip install python-dotenv```If your application takes
        its configuration from environment variables, like a 12-factorapplication,
        launching it in development is not very practical because you have to setthose
        environment variables yourself.To help you with that, you can add Python-dotenv
        to your application to make it load theconfiguration from a `.env` file when
        it is present (e.g. in development) while remainingconfigurable via the environment:```pythonfrom
        dotenv import load_dotenvload_dotenv()  # take environment variables from
        .env.# Code of your application, which uses environment variables (e.g. from
        `os.environ` or# `os.getenv`) as if they came from the actual environment.```By
        default, `load_dotenv` doesn't override existing environment variables.To
        configure the development environment, add a `.env` in the root directory
        of yourproject:```.\u251C\u2500\u2500 .env\u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.py```The
        syntax of `.env` files supported by python-dotenv is similar to that of Bash:```bash#
        Development settingsDOMAIN=example.orgADMIN_EMAIL=admin@${DOMAIN}ROOT_URL=${DOMAIN}/app```If
        you use variables in values, ensure they are surrounded with `{` and `}`,
        like`${DOMAIN}`, as bare variables such as `$DOMAIN` are not expanded.You
        will probably want to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`, especially if it containssecrets
        like a password.See the section \"File format\" below for more information
        about what you can write in a`.env` file.## Other Use Cases### Load configuration
        without altering the environmentThe function `dotenv_values` works more or
        less the same way as `load_dotenv`, except itdoesn't touch the environment,
        it just returns a `dict` with the values parsed from the`.env` file.```pythonfrom
        dotenv import dotenv_valuesconfig = dotenv_values(\".env\")  # config = {\"USER\":
        \"foo\", \"EMAIL\": \"foo@example.org\"}```This notably enables advanced configuration
        management:```pythonimport osfrom dotenv import dotenv_valuesconfig = {    **dotenv_values(\".env.shared\"),
        \ # load shared development variables    **dotenv_values(\".env.secret\"),
        \ # load sensitive variables    **os.environ,  # override loaded values with
        environment variables}```### Parse configuration as a stream`load_dotenv`
        and `dotenv_values` accept [streams][python_streams] via their `stream`argument.
        \ It is thus possible to load the variables from sources other than thefilesystem
        (e.g. the network).```pythonfrom io import StringIOfrom dotenv import load_dotenvconfig
        = StringIO(\"USER=foo\\nEMAIL=foo@example.org\")load_dotenv(stream=config)```###
        Load .env files in IPythonYou can use dotenv in IPython.  By default, it will
        use `find_dotenv` to search for a`.env` file:```python%load_ext dotenv%dotenv```You
        can also specify a path:```python%dotenv relative/or/absolute/path/to/.env```Optional
        flags:- `-o` to override existing variables.- `-v` for increased verbosity.##
        Command-line InterfaceA CLI interface `dotenv` is also included, which helps
        you manipulate the `.env` filewithout manually opening it.```shell$ pip install
        \"python-dotenv[cli]\"$ dotenv set USER foo$ dotenv set EMAIL foo@example.org$
        dotenv listUSER=fooEMAIL=foo@example.org$ dotenv list --format=json{  \"USER\":
        \"foo\",  \"EMAIL\": \"foo@example.org\"}$ dotenv run -- python foo.py```Run
        `dotenv --help` for more information about the options and subcommands.##
        File formatThe format is not formally specified and still improves over time.
        \ That being said,`.env` files should mostly look like Bash files.Keys can
        be unquoted or single-quoted. Values can be unquoted, single- or double-quoted.Spaces
        before and after keys, equal signs, and values are ignored. Values can be
        followedby a comment.  Lines can start with the `export` directive, which
        does not affect theirinterpretation.Allowed escape sequences:- in single-quoted
        values: `\\\\`, `\\'`- in double-quoted values: `\\\\`, `\\'`, `\\\"`, `\\a`,
        `\\b`, `\\f`, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\t`, `\\v`### Multiline valuesIt is possible
        for single- or double-quoted values to span multiple lines.  The followingexamples
        are equivalent:```bashFOO=\"first linesecond line\"``````bashFOO=\"first line\\nsecond
        line\"```### Variable without a valueA variable can have no value:```bashFOO```It
        results in `dotenv_values` associating that variable name with the value `None`
        (e.g.`{\"FOO\": None}`. `load_dotenv`, on the other hand, simply ignores such
        variables.This shouldn't be confused with `FOO=`, in which case the variable
        is associated with theempty string.### Variable expansionPython-dotenv can
        interpolate variables using POSIX variable expansion.With `load_dotenv(override=True)`
        or `dotenv_values()`, the value of a variable is thefirst of the values defined
        in the following list:- Value of that variable in the `.env` file.- Value
        of that variable in the environment.- Default value, if provided.- Empty string.With
        `load_dotenv(override=False)`, the value of a variable is the first of the
        valuesdefined in the following list:- Value of that variable in the environment.-
        Value of that variable in the `.env` file.- Default value, if provided.- Empty
        string.## Related Projects-   [Honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho)

        Documentation statusRapidJSON_ is an extremely fast C++ JSON parser and serialization
        library: this modulewraps it into a Python 3 extension, exposing its serialization/deserialization
        (to/fromeither ``bytes``, ``str`` or *file-like* instances) and `JSON Schema`__
        validationcapabilities.Latest version documentation is automatically rendered
        by `Read the Docs`__.__ http://json-schema.org/documentation.html__ https://python-rapidjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting
        Started---------------First install ``python-rapidjson``:.. code-block:: bash
        \   $ pip install python-rapidjsonor, if you prefer `Conda`__:.. code-block::
        bash    $ conda install -c conda-forge python-rapidjson__ https://conda.io/docs/Basic
        usage looks like this:.. code-block:: python    >>> import rapidjson    >>>
        data = {'foo': 100, 'bar': 'baz'}    >>> rapidjson.dumps(data)    '{\"foo\":100,\"bar\":\"baz\"}'
        \   >>> rapidjson.loads('{\"bar\":\"baz\",\"foo\":100}')    {'bar': 'baz',
        'foo': 100}    >>>    >>> class Stream:    ...   def write(self, data):    ...
        \     print(\"Chunk:\", data)    ...    >>> rapidjson.dump(data, Stream(),
        chunk_size=5)    Chunk: b'{\"foo'    Chunk: b'\":100'    Chunk: b',\"bar'
        \   Chunk: b'\":\"ba'    Chunk: b'z\"}'Development-----------If you want to
        install the development version (maybe to contribute fixes orenhancements)
        you may clone the repository:.. code-block:: bash    $ git clone --recursive
        https://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson.git.. note:: The ``--recursive``
        option is needed because we use a *submodule* to          include RapidJSON_
        sources. Alternatively you can do a plain          ``clone`` immediately followed
        by a ``git submodule update --init``.          Alternatively, if you already
        have (a *compatible* version of)          RapidJSON includes around, you can
        compile the module specifying          their location with the option ``--rj-include-dir``,
        for example:          .. code-block:: shell             $ python3 setup.py
        build --rj-include-dir=/usr/include/rapidjsonA set of makefiles implement
        most common operations, such as *build*, *check*and *release*; see ``make
        help`` output for a list of available targets.Performance-----------``python-rapidjson``
        tries to be as performant as possible while stayingcompatible with the ``json``
        module.See the `this section`__ in the documentation for a comparison with
        other JSON libraries.__ https://python-rapidjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.htmlIncompatibility---------------Although
        we tried to implement an API similar to the standard library ``json``, being
        astrict *drop-in* replacement in not our goal and we have decided to depart
        from there insome aspects. See `this section`__ in the documentation for further
        details.__ https://python-rapidjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#incompatibilities..

      Description: 'pytz - World Timezone Definitions for Python============================================:Author:
        Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>Introduction~~~~~~~~~~~~pytz brings
        the Olson tz database into Python. This library allowsaccurate and cross platform
        timezone calculations using Python 2.4or higher. It also solves the issue
        of ambiguous times at the endof daylight saving time, which you can read more
        about in the PythonLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).Almost all of the
        Olson timezones are supported... note::    Projects using Python 3.9 or later
        should be using the support    now included as part of the standard library,
        and third party    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.    pytz
        offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with    code written for
        earlier versions of Python... note::    This library differs from the documented
        Python API for    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock    times
        you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this    document.
        In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local    times that cross DST
        boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect    timezone (ie. subtract 1
        minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead
        of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A    ``normalize()`` method is provided
        to correct this. Unfortunately these    issues cannot be resolved without
        modifying the Python datetime    implementation (see PEP-431).Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~This
        package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using thestandard
        Python distutils.If you are installing using ``pip``, you don''t need to download
        anything as thelatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::    pip
        install pytzIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command
        as anadministrative user::    python setup.py installpytz for Enterprise~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Available
        as part of the Tidelift Subscription.The maintainers of pytz and thousands
        of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support
        and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.
        Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers
        of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.Example
        & Usage~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Localized times and date arithmetic----------------------------------->>>
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta>>> from pytz import timezone>>> import
        pytz>>> utc = pytz.utc>>> utc.zone''UTC''>>> eastern = timezone(''US/Eastern'')>>>
        eastern.zone''US/Eastern''>>> amsterdam = timezone(''Europe/Amsterdam'')>>>
        fmt = ''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z''This library only supports two ways of building
        a localized time. Thefirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by
        the pytz library.This is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with
        no timezoneinformation):>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27,
        6, 0, 0))>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500The second
        way of building a localized time is by converting an existinglocalized time
        using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)>>>
        ams_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100''Unfortunately using the
        tzinfo argument of the standard datetimeconstructors ''''does not work''''
        with pytz for many timezones.>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  #
        /!\ Does not work this way!''2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018''It is safe for
        timezones without daylight saving transitions though, suchas UTC:>>> datetime(2002,
        10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\ Not recommended except
        for UTC''2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000''The preferred way of dealing with times
        is to always work in UTC,converting to localtime only when generating output
        to be readby humans.>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)>>>
        loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:00:00
        EST-0500''This library also allows you to do date arithmetic using localtimes,
        although it is more complicated than working in UTC as youneed to use the
        ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving timeand other timezone transitions.
        In this example, ``loc_dt`` is setto the instant when daylight saving time
        ends in the US/Easterntimezone.>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)>>>
        before.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500''>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:50:00 EDT-0400''>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))>>>
        after.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500''Creating local times is
        also tricky, and the reason why working withlocal times is not recommended.
        Unfortunately, you cannot just passa ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing
        a datetime (see the nextsection for more details)>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10,
        27, 1, 30, 0)>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EDT-0400''>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EST-0500''Converting between timezones is more easily done, using
        thestandard astimezone method.>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899,
        tz=utc)>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> au_tz =
        timezone(''Australia/Sydney'')>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-27
        08:34:59 AEDT+1100''>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26
        21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2TrueYou can take shortcuts when dealing
        with the UTC side of timezoneconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()``
        are not reallynecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions
        todeal with.>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26
        21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> au_tz = timezone(''Australia/Sydney'')>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))>>>
        au_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100''>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)>>>
        utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000''``tzinfo`` API--------------The
        ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function havebeen extended
        to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``parameter to the ``utcoffset()``,
        ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.>>> tz = timezone(''America/St_Johns'')>>>
        normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)The
        ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only usedduring
        DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal,
        is_dst=True))-1 day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))1:00:00>>>
        tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)''NDT''>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))-1
        day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))1:00:00>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous,
        is_dst=True)''NDT''>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))-1 day, 21:30:00>>>
        tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds3600>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)''NDT''>>>
        print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))-1 day, 20:30:00>>> tz.dst(ambiguous,
        is_dst=False)datetime.timedelta(0)>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)''NST''If
        ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raisean ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError``
        exception.>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))-1 day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(normal))1:00:00>>>
        tz.tzname(normal)''NDT''>>> import pytz.exceptions>>> try:...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)...
        except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00>>>
        try:...     tz.dst(ambiguous)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00>>>
        try:...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00Problems
        with Localtime~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The major problem we have to deal with
        is that certain datetimesmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern
        timezoneon the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequencehappens:    -
        01:00 EDT occurs    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned
        back 1 hour      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)In fact, every
        instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This meansthat if you try and
        create a time in the ''US/Eastern'' timezonethe standard datetime syntax,
        there is no way to specify if you meantbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time
        transition. Using thepytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated
        guess:>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))>>>
        loc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500''As you can see, the system
        has chosen one for you and there is a 50%chance of it being out by one hour.
        For some applications, this doesnot matter. However, if you are trying to
        schedule meetings with peoplein different timezones or analyze log files it
        is not acceptable.The best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The
        pytzpackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation byincluding
        a special UTC implementation based on the standard Pythonreference implementation
        in the Python documentation.The UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance,
        and pickles to asmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementationcan
        be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone(''UTC'').>>> import pickle,
        pytz>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)>>>
        p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)17>>>
        new = pickle.loads(p)>>> new == dtTrue>>> new is dtFalse>>> new.tzinfo is
        dt.tzinfoTrue>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone(''UTC'')TrueNote that
        some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,Greenwich, Universal,
        etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from theseother timezones, and they
        are not equivalent. For this reason, they willnot compare the same in Python.>>>
        utc == pytz.timezone(''GMT'')FalseSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.If
        you insist on working with local times, this library provides afacility for
        constructing them unambiguously:>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30,
        00)>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt,
        is_dst=False)>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + '' / '' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500If you pass None as the is_dst
        flag to localize(), pytz will refuse toguess and raise exceptions if you try
        to build ambiguous or non-existenttimes.For example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002
        happened twice in the US/Easterntimezone when the clocks where put back at
        the end of Daylight SavingTime:>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)>>>
        try:...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % dt)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00Similarly,
        2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in theUS/Eastern timezone,
        as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skippingthe entire hour:>>> dt =
        datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)>>> try:...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)...
        except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:
        %s'' % dt)pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00Both of
        these exceptions share a common base class to make error handlingeasier:>>>
        isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)True>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(),
        pytz.InvalidTimeError)TrueA special case is where countries change their timezone
        definitionswith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsawswitched
        from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savingstransition.
        So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clockswere wound back
        24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannotbe specified without
        referring to the timezone abbreviation or theactual UTC offset. In this case
        midnight happened twice, neither timeduring a daylight saving time period.
        pytz handles this transition bytreating the ambiguous period before the switch
        as daylight savingstime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.>>>
        warsaw = pytz.timezone(''Europe/Warsaw'')>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915,
        8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:59:59
        WMT+0124''>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59),
        is_dst=False)>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100''>>>
        switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)>>>
        switch_dt.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100''>>> str(switch_dt -
        amb_dt1)''0:24:01''>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)''0:00:01''The best way of
        creating a time during an ambiguous time period isby converting from another
        timezone such as UTC:>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)>>>
        utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100''The
        standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not tohandle them,
        such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Easterntimezone definition
        from the Python documentation (Note that thisimplementation only works for
        dates between 1987 and 2006 - it isincluded for tests only!):>>> from pytz.reference
        import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10,
        27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)>>> str(dt)''2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00''>>> str(dt
        + timedelta(hours=1))''2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00''>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))''2002-10-27
        02:30:00-05:00''>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))''2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00''Notice
        the first two results? At first glance you might think they arecorrect, but
        taking the UTC offset into account you find that they areactually two hours
        appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.>>> from pytz.reference import UTC
        # pytz.reference only for tests>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))''2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00''>>>
        str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))''2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00''Country
        Information~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A mechanism is provided to access the timezones
        commonly in usefor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country

        ZealandWhat is UTC~~~~~~~~~~~''UTC'' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It
        is a successor to, but distinctfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various
        definitions of UniversalTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating
        clocks and timemeasurement.All other timezones are defined relative to UTC,
        and include offsets likeUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive
        the local time. Nodaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone
        to performdate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities
        causedby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone,
        ormobile computers that roam through multiple timezones...  _Coordinated Universal
        Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_TimeHelpers~~~~~~~There
        are two lists of timezones provided.``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list
        of the timezone names that canbe used.>>> from pytz import all_timezones>>>
        len(all_timezones) >= 500True>>> ''Etc/Greenwich'' in all_timezonesTrue``common_timezones``
        is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn''tcontain deprecated zones
        or historical zones, except for a few I''vedeemed in common usage, such as
        US/Eastern (open a bug report if youthink other timezones are deserving of
        being included here). It is alsoa sequence of strings.>>> from pytz import
        common_timezones>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)True>>> ''Etc/Greenwich''
        in common_timezonesFalse>>> ''Australia/Melbourne'' in common_timezonesTrue>>>
        ''US/Eastern'' in common_timezonesTrue>>> ''Canada/Eastern'' in common_timezonesTrue>>>
        ''Australia/Yancowinna'' in all_timezonesTrue>>> ''Australia/Yancowinna''
        in common_timezonesFalseBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are
        alphabeticallysorted:>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()>>>
        common_timezones == common_timezones_dupeTrue>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]>>>
        all_timezones_dupe.sort()>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupeTrue``all_timezones``
        and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set,
        common_timezones_set>>> ''US/Eastern'' in all_timezones_setTrue>>> ''US/Eastern''
        in common_timezones_setTrue>>> ''Australia/Victoria'' in common_timezones_setFalseYou
        can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countriesusing the
        ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166two letter country
        code.>>> from pytz import country_timezones>>> print('' ''.join(country_timezones(''ch'')))Europe/Zurich>>>
        print('' ''.join(country_timezones(''CH'')))Europe/ZurichInternationalization
        - i18n/l10n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pytz is an interface to the IANA
        database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium''s Unicode Locales
        (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_project provides translations. Python packages
        such as`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_and
        Thomas Khyn''s `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be usedto
        access these translations from Python.License~~~~~~~MIT license.This code
        is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope PublicLicense,  Version
        2.1 (ZPL).I''m happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in
        otheropen source projects.Latest Versions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This package will
        be updated after releases of the Olson timezonedatabase.  The latest version
        can be downloaded from the `Python PackageIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The
        code that is usedto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and availableusing
        git::    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.gitAnnouncements of new
        releases are made on`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the`Atom
        feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_hosted there.Bugs,
        Feature Requests & Patches~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bugs should be reported
        on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.Feature requests are
        unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directedto timezone support
        now built into Python or packages that work with it.Security Issues~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Reports
        about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.Issues
        & Limitations~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects
        using Python 3.9 or later  are best served by using the timezone functionaly
        now included in core  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata
        <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the
        nearest whole minute, so timezones  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will
        be up to 30 seconds out. This  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.-
        If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can''t fix  it.
        pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and  changes
        to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.  If you find errors
        they should be reported to the time zone mailing  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.Further

      Description: 'Requests-OAuthlib |build-status| |coverage-status| |docs|=========================================================This
        project provides first-class OAuth library support for `Requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io>`_.The
        OAuth 1 workflow--------------------OAuth 1 can seem overly complicated and
        it sure has its quirks. Luckily,requests_oauthlib hides most of these and
        let you focus at the task at hand.Accessing protected resources using requests_oauthlib
        is as simple as:.. code-block:: pycon    >>> from requests_oauthlib import
        OAuth1Session    >>> twitter = OAuth1Session(''client_key'',                                client_secret=''client_secret'',                                resource_owner_key=''resource_owner_key'',                                resource_owner_secret=''resource_owner_secret'')    >>>
        url = ''https://api.twitter.com/1/account/settings.json''    >>> r = twitter.get(url)Before
        accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from yourprovider
        (e.g. Twitter) and authorization from the user for whom you wish toretrieve
        resources for. You can read all about this in the full`OAuth 1 workflow guide
        on RTD <https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth1_workflow.html>`_.The
        OAuth 2 workflow--------------------OAuth 2 is generally simpler than OAuth
        1 but comes in more flavours. The mostcommon being the Authorization Code
        Grant, also known as the WebApplicationflow.Fetching a protected resource
        after obtaining an access token can be extremelysimple. However, before accessing
        resources you will need to obtain a fewcredentials from your provider (e.g.
        Google) and authorization from the userfor whom you wish to retrieve resources
        for. You can read all about this in thefull `OAuth 2 workflow guide on RTD
        <https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html>`_.Installation-------------To
        install requests and requests_oauthlib you can use pip:.. code-block:: bash    pip

        Documentation Status   :scale: 100%   :target: https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/History-------v2.0.0
        (22 March 2024)++++++++++++++++++++++++Full set of changes are in [github](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/milestone/4?closed=1).Additions
        & changes:- ``OAuth2Session`` now correctly uses the ``self.verify`` value
        if ``verify``  is not overridden in ``fetch_token`` and ``refresh_token``.
        Fixes `#404  <https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/issues/404>`_.-
        ``OAuth2Session`` constructor now uses its ``client.scope`` when a ``client``  is
        provided and ``scope`` is not overridden. Fixes `#408  <https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/issues/408>`_-
        Add ``refresh_token_request`` and ``access_token_request`` compliance hooks-
        Add PKCE support and Auth0 example- Add support for Python 3.8-3.12- Remove
        support of Python 2.x, <3.7- Migrated to Github Action- Updated dependencies-
        Cleanup some docs and examplesv1.4.0 (27 Feb 2024)++++++++++++++++++++++++-
        Version 2.0.0 published initially as 1.4.0, it was yanked eventually.v1.3.1
        (21 January 2022)++++++++++++++++++++++++- Add initial support for OAuth Mutual
        TLS (draft-ietf-oauth-mtls)- Removed outdated LinkedIn Compliance Fixes- Add
        eBay compliance fix- Add Spotify OAuth 2 Tutorial- Add support for python
        3.8, 3.9- Fixed LinkedIn Compliance Fixes- Fixed ReadTheDocs Documentation
        and sphinx errors- Moved pipeline to GitHub Actionsv1.3.0 (6 November 2019)++++++++++++++++++++++++-
        Instagram compliance fix- Added ``force_querystring`` argument to fetch_token()
        method on OAuth2Sessionv1.2.0 (14 January 2019)++++++++++++++++++++++++- This
        project now depends on OAuthlib 3.0.0 and above. It does **not** support  versions
        of OAuthlib before 3.0.0.- Updated oauth2 tests to use ''sess'' for an OAuth2Session
        instance instead of `auth`  because OAuth2Session objects and methods acceept
        an `auth` paramether which is  typically an instance of `requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth`-
        `OAuth2Session.fetch_token` previously tried to guess how and where to provide  "client"
        and "user" credentials incorrectly. This was incompatible with some  OAuth
        servers and incompatible with breaking changes in oauthlib that seek to  correctly
        provide the `client_id`. The older implementation also did not raise  the
        correct exceptions when username and password are not present on Legacy  clients.-
        Avoid automatic netrc authentication for OAuth2Session.v1.1.0 (9 January 2019)+++++++++++++++++++++++-
        Adjusted version specifier for ``oauthlib`` dependency: this project is  not
        yet compatible with ``oauthlib`` 3.0.0.- Dropped dependency on ``nose``.-
        Minor changes to clean up the code and make it more readable/maintainable.v1.0.0
        (4 June 2018)++++++++++++++++++++- **Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python
        3.3.**  This project now supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4 and above.- Added
        several examples to the documentation.- Added plentymarkets compliance fix.-
        Added a ``token`` property to OAuth1Session, to match the corresponding  ``token``
        property on OAuth2Session.v0.8.0 (14 February 2017)+++++++++++++++++++++++++-
        Added Fitbit compliance fix.- Fixed an issue where newlines in the response
        body for the access token  request would cause errors when trying to extract
        the token.- Fixed an issue introduced in v0.7.0 where users passing ``auth``
        to several  methods would encounter conflicts with the ``client_id`` and  ``client_secret``-derived
        auth. The user-supplied ``auth`` argument is now  used in preference to those
        options.v0.7.0 (22 September 2016)++++++++++++++++++++++++++- Allowed ``OAuth2Session.request``
        to take the ``client_id`` and  ``client_secret`` parameters for the purposes
        of automatic token refresh,  which may need them.v0.6.2 (12 July 2016)+++++++++++++++++++++-
        Use ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` for the Authorization header if  provided.-
        Allow explicit bypass of the Authorization header by setting ``auth=False``.-
        Pass through the ``proxies`` kwarg when refreshing tokens.- Miscellaneous
        cleanups.v0.6.1 (19 February 2016)+++++++++++++++++++++++++- Fixed a bug when
        sending authorization in headers with no username and  password present.-
        Make sure we clear the session token before obtaining a new one.- Some improvements
        to the Slack compliance fix.- Avoid timing problems around token refresh.-
        Allow passing arbitrary arguments to requests when calling  ``fetch_request_token``
        and ``fetch_access_token``.v0.6.0 (14 December 2015)+++++++++++++++++++++++++-
        Add compliance fix for Slack.- Add compliance fix for Mailchimp.- ``TokenRequestDenied``
        exceptions now carry the entire response, not just the  status code.- Pass
        through keyword arguments when refreshing tokens automatically.- Send authorization
        in headers, not just body, to maximize compatibility.- More getters/setters
        available for OAuth2 session client values.- Allow sending custom headers
        when refreshing tokens, and set some defaults.v0.5.0 (4 May 2015)+++++++++++++++++++-
        Fix ``TypeError`` being raised instead of ``TokenMissing`` error.- Raise requests
        exceptions on 4XX and 5XX responses in the OAuth2 flow.- Avoid ``AttributeError``
        when initializing the ``OAuth2Session`` class  without complete client information.v0.4.2
        (16 October 2014)++++++++++++++++++++++++- New ``authorized`` property on
        OAuth1Session and OAuth2Session, which allows  you to easily determine if
        the session is already authorized with OAuth tokens  or not.- New ``TokenMissing``
        and ``VerifierMissing`` exception classes for OAuth1Session:  this will make
        it easier to catch and identify these exceptions.v0.4.1 (6 June 2014)++++++++++++++++++++-
        New install target ``[rsa]`` for people using OAuth1 RSA-SHA1 signature  method.-
        Fixed bug in OAuth2 where supplied state param was not used in auth url.-
        OAuth2 HTTPS checking can be disabled by setting environment variable  ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT``.-
        OAuth1 now re-authorize upon redirects.- OAuth1 token fetching now raise a
        detailed error message when the  response body is incorrectly encoded or the
        request was denied.- Added support for custom OAuth1 clients.- OAuth2 compliance
        fix for Sina Weibo.- Multiple fixes to facebook compliance fix.- Compliance
        fixes now re-encode body properly as bytes in Python 3.- Logging now properly
        done under ``requests_oauthlib`` namespace instead  of piggybacking on oauthlib
        namespace.- Logging introduced for OAuth1 auth and session.v0.4.0 (29 September
        2013)++++++++++++++++++++++++++- OAuth1Session methods only return unicode
        strings. #55.- Renamed requests_oauthlib.core to requests_oauthlib.oauth1_auth
        for consistency. #79.- Added Facebook compliance fix and access_token_response
        hook to OAuth2Session. #63.- Added LinkedIn compliance fix.- Added refresh_token_response
        compliance hook, invoked before parsing the refresh token.- Correctly limit

        is a pure-Python RSA implementation. It supportsencryption and decryption,
        signing and verifying signatures, and keygeneration according to PKCS#1 version
        1.5. It can be used as a Pythonlibrary as well as on the commandline. The
        code was mostly written bySybren A.  St\xFCvel.Documentation can be found
        at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa). For all changes, check
        [the changelog](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).Download
        and install using:    pip install rsaor download it from the [Python Package

        SecurityBecause of how Python internally stores numbers, it is very hard (if
        not impossible) to make a pure-Python program secure against timing attacks.
        This library is no exception, so use it with care. See https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/
        for more info.## Setup of Development Environment```python3 -m venv .venv.
        ./.venv/bin/activatepip install poetrypoetry install```## Publishing a New
        ReleaseSince this project is considered critical on the Python Package Index,two-factor
        authentication is required. For uploading packages to PyPi, an APIkey is required;
        username+password will not work.First, generate an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/.
        Then,use this token when publishing instead of your username and password.As
        username, use `__token__`.As password, use the token itself, including the
        `pypi-` prefix.See https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken for help using API tokens
        to publish. Thisis what I have in `~/.pypirc`:```[distutils]index-servers
        =    rsa# Use `twine upload -r rsa` to upload with this token.[rsa]  repository
        = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/  username = __token__  password = pypi-token``````.
        ./.venv/bin/activatepip install twinepoetry buildtwine check dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz
        dist/rsa-4.9-*.whltwine upload -r rsa dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whl```The
        `pip install twine` is necessary as Python-RSA requires Python >= 3.6, andTwine
        requires at least version 3.7. This means Poetry refuses to add it asdependency."

        [https://www.starlette.io/](https://www.starlette.io/)---# StarletteStarlette
        is a lightweight [ASGI][asgi] framework/toolkit,which is ideal for building
        async web services in Python.It is production-ready, and gives you the following:*
        A lightweight, low-complexity HTTP web framework.* WebSocket support.* In-process
        background tasks.* Startup and shutdown events.* Test client built on `httpx`.*
        CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.* Session and Cookie support.*
        100% test coverage.* 100% type annotated codebase.* Few hard dependencies.*
        Compatible with `asyncio` and `trio` backends.* Great overall performance
        [against independent benchmarks][techempower].## RequirementsPython 3.8+##
        Installation```shell$ pip3 install starlette```You'll also want to install
        an ASGI server, such as [uvicorn](http://www.uvicorn.org/), [daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne/),
        or [hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/).```shell$ pip3 install
        uvicorn```## Example**example.py**:```pythonfrom starlette.applications import
        Starlettefrom starlette.responses import JSONResponsefrom starlette.routing
        import Routeasync def homepage(request):    return JSONResponse({'hello':
        'world'})routes = [    Route(\"/\", endpoint=homepage)]app = Starlette(debug=True,
        routes=routes)```Then run the application using Uvicorn:```shell$ uvicorn
        example:app```For a more complete example, see [encode/starlette-example](https://github.com/encode/starlette-example).##
        DependenciesStarlette only requires `anyio`, and the following are optional:*
        [`httpx`][httpx] - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.* [`jinja2`][jinja2]
        - Required if you want to use `Jinja2Templates`.* [`python-multipart`][python-multipart]
        - Required if you want to support form parsing, with `request.form()`.* [`itsdangerous`][itsdangerous]
        - Required for `SessionMiddleware` support.* [`pyyaml`][pyyaml] - Required
        for `SchemaGenerator` support.You can install all of these with `pip3 install
        starlette[full]`.## Framework or ToolkitStarlette is designed to be used either
        as a complete framework, or asan ASGI toolkit. You can use any of its components
        independently.```pythonfrom starlette.responses import PlainTextResponseasync
        def app(scope, receive, send):    assert scope['type'] == 'http'    response
        = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')    await response(scope, receive, send)```Run
        the `app` application in `example.py`:```shell$ uvicorn example:appINFO: Started
        server process [11509]INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press
        CTRL+C to quit)```Run uvicorn with `--reload` to enable auto-reloading on
        code changes.## ModularityThe modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes
        building re-usablecomponents that can be shared between any ASGI framework.
        This should enablean ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications.The
        clean API separation also means it's easier to understand each componentin
        isolation.---<p align=\"center\"><i>Starlette is <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">BSD

        file formats by TensorFlow I/O can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/io/api_docs/python/tfio).The
        use of tensorflow-io is straightforward with keras. Below is an exampleto

        loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])# Fit the model.model.fit(d_train,
        epochs=5, steps_per_epoch=200)```In the above [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
        example, the URL''sto access the dataset files are passed directly to the
        `tfio.IODataset.from_mnist` API call.This is due to the inherent support that
        `tensorflow-io` provides for `HTTP`/`HTTPS` file system,thus eliminating the
        need for downloading and saving datasets on a local directory.NOTE: Since
        `tensorflow-io` is able to detect and uncompress the MNIST dataset automatically
        if needed,we can pass the URL''s for the compressed files (gzip) to the API
        call as is.Please check the official [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/io)
        for moredetailed and interesting usages of the package.## Installation###
        Python PackageThe `tensorflow-io` Python package can be installed with pip
        directly using:```sh$ pip install tensorflow-io```People who are a little
        more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:```sh$ pip install tensorflow-io-nightly```To
        ensure you have a version of TensorFlow that is compatible with TensorFlow-IO,you
        can specify the `tensorflow` extra requirement during install:```pip install
        tensorflow-io[tensorflow]```Similar extras exist for the `tensorflow-gpu`,
        `tensorflow-cpu` and `tensorflow-rocm`packages.### Docker ImagesIn addition
        to the pip packages, the docker images can be used to quickly get started.For
        stable builds:```sh$ docker pull tfsigio/tfio:latest$ docker run -it --rm
        --name tfio-latest tfsigio/tfio:latest```For nightly builds:```sh$ docker
        pull tfsigio/tfio:nightly$ docker run -it --rm --name tfio-nightly tfsigio/tfio:nightly```###
        R PackageOnce the `tensorflow-io` Python package has been successfully installed,
        youcan install the development version of the R package from GitHub via the
        following:```rif (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")remotes::install_github("tensorflow/io",
        subdir = "R-package")```### TensorFlow Version CompatibilityTo ensure compatibility
        with TensorFlow, it is recommended to install a matchingversion of TensorFlow
        I/O according to the table below. You can find the listof releases [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/io/releases).|

        |Because of manylinux2010 requirement, TensorFlow I/O is built withUbuntu:16.04
        + Developer Toolset 7 (GCC 7.3) on Linux. Configurationwith Ubuntu 16.04 with
        Developer Toolset 7 is not exactly straightforward.If the system have docker
        installed, then the following commandwill automatically build manylinux2010
        compatible whl package:```sh#!/usr/bin/env bashls dist/*for f in dist/*.whl;
        do  docker run -i --rm -v $PWD:/v -w /v --net=host quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64
        bash -x -e /v/tools/build/auditwheel repair --plat manylinux2010_x86_64 $fdonesudo
        chown -R $(id -nu):$(id -ng) .ls wheelhouse/*```It takes some time to build,
        but once complete, there will be python`3.5`, `3.6`, `3.7` compatible whl
        packages available in `wheelhouse`directory.On macOS, the same command could
        be used. However, the script expects `python` in shelland will only generate
        a whl package that matches the version of `python` in shell. Ifyou want to
        build a whl package for a specific python then you have to alias this versionof
        python to `python` in shell. See [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)Auditwheel
        step for instructions how to do that.Note the above command is also the command
        we use when releasing packages for Linux and macOS.TensorFlow I/O uses both
        GitHub Workflows and Google CI (Kokoro) for continuous integration.GitHub
        Workflows is used for macOS build and test. Kokoro is used for Linux build
        and test.Again, because of the manylinux2010 requirement, on Linux whl packages
        are alwaysbuilt with Ubuntu 16.04 + Developer Toolset 7. Tests are done on
        a variatiy of systemswith different python3 versions to ensure a good coverage:|

        done with live systems, meaning we install Prometheus/Kafka/Ignite on CI machine
        beforethe test is run. Some tests such as Kinesis, PubSub, and Azure Storage
        are donethrough official or non-official emulators. Offline tests are also

        in several ways.In order of precedence:1. Calling `colored` or `cprint` with
        a truthy `no_color` disables colour.2. Calling `colored` or `cprint` with
        a truthy `force_color` forces colour.3. Setting the `ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED`
        environment variable to any value disables colour.4. Setting the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/)
        environment variable to any value   disables colour.5. Setting the [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://force-color.org/)
        environment variable to any   value forces colour.6. Setting the `TERM` environment
        variable to `dumb`, or using such a   [dumb terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Character-oriented_terminal),   disables
        colour.7. Finally, termcolor will attempt to detect whether the terminal supports
        colour.'

        of thePython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.urllib3 brings
        many critical features that are missing from the Pythonstandard libraries:-
        Thread safety.- Connection pooling.- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.- File
        uploads with multipart encoding.- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing
        with HTTP redirects.- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.-
        Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.- 100% test coverage.urllib3 is powerful
        and easy to use:```python3>>> import urllib3>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\",
        \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")>>> resp.status200>>> resp.datab\"User-agent:
        *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"```## Installingurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):```bash$
        python -m pip install urllib3```Alternatively, you can grab the latest source
        code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):```bash$ git clone

        Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/uvicorn.svg?color=%2334D058)](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn)**Documentation**:
        [https://www.uvicorn.org](https://www.uvicorn.org)---Uvicorn is an ASGI web
        server implementation for Python.Until recently Python has lacked a minimal
        low-level server/application interface forasync frameworks. The [ASGI specification][asgi]
        fills this gap, and means we're now able tostart building a common set of
        tooling usable across all async frameworks.Uvicorn supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.##
        QuickstartInstall using `pip`:```shell$ pip install uvicorn```This will install
        uvicorn with minimal (pure Python) dependencies.```shell$ pip install 'uvicorn[standard]'```This
        will install uvicorn with \"Cython-based\" dependencies (where possible) and
        other \"optional extras\".In this context, \"Cython-based\" means the following:-
        the event loop `uvloop` will be installed and used if possible.- the http
        protocol will be handled by `httptools` if possible.Moreover, \"optional extras\"
        means that:- the websocket protocol will be handled by `websockets` (should
        you want to use `wsproto` you'd need to install it manually) if possible.-
        the `--reload` flag in development mode will use `watchfiles`.- windows users
        will have `colorama` installed for the colored logs.- `python-dotenv` will
        be installed should you want to use the `--env-file` option.- `PyYAML` will
        be installed to allow you to provide a `.yaml` file to `--log-config`, if
        desired.Create an application, in `example.py`:```pythonasync def app(scope,
        receive, send):    assert scope['type'] == 'http'    await send({        'type':
        'http.response.start',        'status': 200,        'headers': [            (b'content-type',
        b'text/plain'),        ],    })    await send({        'type': 'http.response.body',
        \       'body': b'Hello, world!',    })```Run the server:```shell$ uvicorn
        example:app```---## Why ASGI?Most well established Python Web frameworks started
        out as WSGI-based frameworks.WSGI applications are a single, synchronous callable
        that takes a request and returns a response.This doesn\u2019t allow for long-lived
        connections, like you get with long-poll HTTP or WebSocket connections,which
        WSGI doesn't support well.Having an async concurrency model also allows for
        options such as lightweight background tasks,and can be less of a limiting
        factor for endpoints that have long periods being blocked on networkI/O such
        as dealing with slow HTTP requests.---## Alternative ASGI serversA strength
        of the ASGI protocol is that it decouples the server implementationfrom the
        application framework. This allows for an ecosystem of interoperatingwebservers
        and application frameworks.### DaphneThe first ASGI server implementation,
        originally developed to power Django Channels, is [the Daphne webserver][daphne].It
        is run widely in production, and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.Any
        of the example applications given here can equally well be run using `daphne`
        instead.```$ pip install daphne$ daphne app:App```### Hypercorn[Hypercorn][hypercorn]
        was initially part of the Quart web framework, beforebeing separated out into
        a standalone ASGI server.Hypercorn supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.It
        also supports [the excellent `trio` async framework][trio], as an alternative
        to `asyncio`.```$ pip install hypercorn$ hypercorn app:App```### Mangum[Mangum][mangum]
        is an adapter for using ASGI applications with AWS Lambda & API Gateway.---<p

        also check out the`wiki <https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop/wiki>`_.Performance-----------uvloop

        http://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/The above chart
        shows the performance of an echo server with differentmessage sizes.  The
        *sockets* benchmark uses ``loop.sock_recv()`` and``loop.sock_sendall()`` methods;
        the *streams* benchmark uses asynciohigh-level streams, created by the ``asyncio.start_server()``
        function;and the *protocol* benchmark uses ``loop.create_server()`` with a
        simpleecho protocol.  Read more about uvloop in a`blog post <http://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/>`_about
        it.Installation------------uvloop requires Python 3.8 or greater and is available
        on PyPI.Use pip to install it::    $ pip install uvloopNote that it is highly
        recommended to **upgrade pip before** installinguvloop with::    $ pip install
        -U pipUsing uvloop------------As of uvloop 0.18, the preferred way of using
        it is via the``uvloop.run()`` helper function:.. code:: python    import uvloop    async
        def main():        # Main entry-point.        ...    uvloop.run(main())``uvloop.run()``
        works by simply configuring ``asyncio.run()``to use uvloop, passing all of
        the arguments to it, such as ``debug``,e.g. ``uvloop.run(main(), debug=True)``.With
        Python 3.11 and earlier the following alternativesnippet can be used:.. code::
        python    import asyncio    import sys    import uvloop    async def main():        #
        Main entry-point.        ...    if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):        with
        asyncio.Runner(loop_factory=uvloop.new_event_loop) as runner:            runner.run(main())    else:        uvloop.install()        asyncio.run(main())Building
        From Source--------------------To build uvloop, you''ll need Python 3.8 or
        greater:1. Clone the repository:   .. code::    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:MagicStack/uvloop.git    $
        cd uvloop2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:   .. code::    $
        python3.7 -m venv uvloop-dev    $ source uvloop-dev/bin/activate3. Install
        development dependencies:   ..  code::    $ pip install -e .[dev]4. Build
        and run tests:   .. code::    $ make    $ make testLicense-------uvloop is

      Description: 'wrapt=====|Actions| |PyPI|The aim of the **wrapt** module is to
        provide a transparent object proxyfor Python, which can be used as the basis
        for the construction of functionwrappers and decorator functions.The **wrapt**
        module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goesway beyond existing
        mechanisms such as ``functools.wraps()`` to ensure thatdecorators preserve
        introspectability, signatures, type checking abilitiesetc. The decorators
        that can be constructed using this module will work infar more scenarios than
        typical decorators and provide more predictable andconsistent behaviour.To
        ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension moduleis
        used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to apure Python
        implementation is also provided where a target system does nothave a compiler
        to allow the C extension to be compiled.Documentation-------------For further
        information on the **wrapt** module see:* http://wrapt.readthedocs.org/Quick
        Start-----------To implement your decorator you need to first define a wrapper
        function.This will be called each time a decorated function is called. The
        wrapperfunction needs to take four positional arguments:* ``wrapped`` - The
        wrapped function which in turns needs to be called by your wrapper function.*
        ``instance`` - The object to which the wrapped function was bound when it
        was called.* ``args`` - The list of positional arguments supplied when the
        decorated function was called.* ``kwargs`` - The dictionary of keyword arguments
        supplied when the decorated function was called.The wrapper function would
        do whatever it needs to, but would usually inturn call the wrapped function
        that is passed in via the ``wrapped``argument.The decorator ``@wrapt.decorator``
        then needs to be applied to the wrapperfunction to convert it into a decorator
        which can in turn be applied toother functions... code-block:: python    import
        wrapt        @wrapt.decorator    def pass_through(wrapped, instance, args,
        kwargs):        return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)    @pass_through    def function():        passIf
        you wish to implement a decorator which accepts arguments, then wrap thedefinition
        of the decorator in a function closure. Any arguments suppliedto the outer
        function when the decorator is applied, will be available tothe inner wrapper
        when the wrapped function is called... code-block:: python    import wrapt    def
        with_arguments(myarg1, myarg2):        @wrapt.decorator        def wrapper(wrapped,
        instance, args, kwargs):            return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)        return
        wrapper    @with_arguments(1, 2)    def function():        passWhen applied
        to a normal function or static method, the wrapper functionwhen called will
        be passed ``None`` as the ``instance`` argument.When applied to an instance
        method, the wrapper function when called willbe passed the instance of the
        class the method is being called on as the``instance`` argument. This will
        be the case even when the instance methodwas called explicitly via the class
        and the instance passed as the firstargument. That is, the instance will never
        be passed as part of ``args``.When applied to a class method, the wrapper
        function when called will bepassed the class type as the ``instance`` argument.When
        applied to a class, the wrapper function when called will be passed``None``
        as the ``instance`` argument. The ``wrapped`` argument in thiscase will be
        the class.The above rules can be summarised with the following example...
        code-block:: python    import inspect        @wrapt.decorator    def universal(wrapped,
        instance, args, kwargs):        if instance is None:            if inspect.isclass(wrapped):                #
        Decorator was applied to a class.                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)            else:                #
        Decorator was applied to a function or staticmethod.                return
        wrapped(*args, **kwargs)        else:            if inspect.isclass(instance):                #
        Decorator was applied to a classmethod.                return wrapped(*args,
        **kwargs)            else:                # Decorator was applied to an instancemethod.                return
        wrapped(*args, **kwargs)Using these checks it is therefore possible to create
        a universal decoratorthat can be applied in all situations. It is no longer
        necessary to createdifferent variants of decorators for normal functions and
        instance methods,or use additional wrappers to convert a function decorator
        into one thatwill work for instance methods.In all cases, the wrapped function
        passed to the wrapper function is calledin the same way, with ``args`` and
        ``kwargs`` being passed. The``instance`` argument doesn''t need to be used
        in calling the wrappedfunction.Repository----------Full source code for the

        http://zopeevent.readthedocs.org/en/latest/        :alt: Documentation StatusThe
        ``zope.event`` package provides a simple event system, including:- An event
        publishing API, intended for use by applications which are  unaware of any
        subscribers to their events.- A very simple synchronous event-dispatching
        system, on which more sophisticated  event dispatching systems can be built.
        For example, a type-based  event dispatching system that builds on ``zope.event``
        can be found in  ``zope.component``.Please see http://zopeevent.readthedocs.io/

        StatusThis package is intended to be independently reusable in any Pythonproject.
        It is maintained by the `Zope Toolkit project<https://zopetoolkit.readthedocs.io/>`_.This
        package provides an implementation of "object interfaces" for Python.Interfaces
        are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a givenAPI or contract.
        So, this package can be considered as implementation ofthe `Design By Contract`_
        methodology support in Python... _Design By Contract: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contractFor
        detailed documentation, please see https://zopeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/=========
        Changes=========6.2 (2024-02-16)================- Add preliminary support
        for Python 3.13 as of 3.13a3.- Add support to use the pipe (``|``) syntax
        for ``typing.Union``.  (`#280 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/280>`_)6.1
        (2023-10-05)================- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.12.-
        Add support for Python 3.12.- Fix building of the docs for non-final versions.6.0
        (2023-03-17)================- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.11.-
        Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.- Fix test deprecation warning on Python
        3.11.- Add preliminary support for Python 3.12 as of 3.12a5.- Drop:    + `zope.interface.implements`    +
        `zope.interface.implementsOnly`    + `zope.interface.classProvides`5.5.2 (2022-11-17)==================-
        Add support for building arm64 wheels on macOS.5.5.1 (2022-11-03)==================-
        Add support for final Python 3.11 release.5.5.0 (2022-10-10)==================-
        Add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 (as of 3.11.0rc2).- Add missing Trove
        classifier showing support for Python 3.9.- Add some more entries to ``zope.interface.interfaces.__all__``.-
        Disable unsafe math optimizations in C code.  See `pull request 262  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/262>`_.5.4.0
        (2021-04-15)==================- Make the C implementation of the ``__providedBy__``
        descriptor stop  ignoring all errors raised when accessing the instance''s  ``__provides__``.
        Now it behaves like the Python version and only  catches ``AttributeError``.
        The previous behaviour could lead to  crashing the interpreter in cases of
        recursion and errors. See  `issue 239 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues>`_.-
        Update the ``repr()`` and ``str()`` of various objects to be shorter  and
        more informative. In many cases, the ``repr()`` is now something  that can
        be evaluated to produce an equal object. For example, what  was previously
        printed as ``<implementedBy builtins.list>`` is now  shown as ``classImplements(list,
        IMutableSequence, IIterable)``. See  `issue 236 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/236>`_.-
        Make ``Declaration.__add__`` (as in ``implementedBy(Cls) +  ISomething``)
        try harder to preserve a consistent resolution order  when the two arguments
        share overlapping pieces of the interface  inheritance hierarchy. Previously,
        the right hand side was always  put at the end of the resolution order, which
        could easily produce  invalid orders. See `issue 193  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/193>`_.5.3.0
        (2020-03-21)==================- No changes from 5.3.0a15.3.0a1 (2021-03-18)====================-
        Improve the repr of ``zope.interface.Provides`` to remove ambiguity  about
        what is being provided. This is especially helpful diagnosing  IRO issues.-
        Allow subclasses of ``BaseAdapterRegistry`` (including  ``AdapterRegistry``
        and ``VerifyingAdapterRegistry``) to have  control over the data structures.
        This allows persistent  implementations such as those based on ZODB to choose
        more scalable  options (e.g., BTrees instead of dicts). See `issue 224  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/224>`_.-
        Fix a reference counting issue in ``BaseAdapterRegistry`` that could  lead
        to references to interfaces being kept around even when all  utilities/adapters/subscribers
        providing that interface have been  removed. This is mostly an issue for persistent
        implementations.  Note that this only corrects the issue moving forward, it
        does not  solve any already corrupted reference counts. See `issue 227  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/227>`_.-
        Add the method ``BaseAdapterRegistry.rebuild()``. This can be used  to fix
        the reference counting issue mentioned above, as well as to  update the data
        structures when custom data types have changed.- Add the interface method
        ``IAdapterRegistry.subscribed()`` and  implementation ``BaseAdapterRegistry.subscribed()``
        for querying  directly registered subscribers. See `issue 230  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/230>`_.-
        Add the maintenance method  ``Components.rebuildUtilityRegistryFromLocalCache()``.
        Most users  will not need this, but it can be useful if the ``Components.utilities``  registry
        is suspected to be out of sync with the ``Components``  object itself (this
        might happen to persistent ``Components``  implementations in the face of
        bugs).- Fix the ``Provides`` and ``ClassProvides`` descriptors to stop  allowing
        redundant interfaces (those already implemented by the  underlying class or
        meta class) to produce an inconsistent  resolution order. This is similar
        to the change in ``@implementer``  in 5.1.0, and resolves inconsistent resolution
        orders with  ``zope.proxy`` and ``zope.location``. See `issue 207  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/207>`_.5.2.0
        (2020-11-05)==================- Add documentation section ``Persistency and
        Equality``  (`#218 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/218>`_).-
        Create arm64 wheels.- Add support for Python 3.9.5.1.2 (2020-10-01)==================-
        Make sure to call each invariant only once when validating invariants.  Previously,
        invariants could be called multiple times because when an  invariant is defined
        in an interface, it''s found by in all interfaces  inheriting from that interface.  See
        `pull request 215  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/215/>`_.5.1.1
        (2020-09-30)==================- Fix the method definitions of ``IAdapterRegistry.subscribe``,  ``subscriptions``
        and ``subscribers``. Previously, they all were  defined to accept a ``name``
        keyword argument, but subscribers have  no names and the implementation of
        that interface did not accept  that argument. See `issue 208  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/208>`_.-
        Fix a potential reference leak in the C optimizations. Previously,  applications
        that dynamically created unique ``Specification``  objects (e.g., used ``@implementer``
        on dynamic classes) could  notice a growth of small objects over time leading
        to increased  garbage collection times. See `issue 216  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/216>`_.  ..
        caution::     This leak could prevent interfaces used as the bases of     other
        interfaces from being garbage collected. Those interfaces     will now be
        collected.     One way in which this would manifest was that ``weakref.ref``     objects
        (and things built upon them, like     ``Weak[Key|Value]Dictionary``) would
        continue to have access to     the original object even if there were no other
        visible     references to Python and the original object *should* have been     collected.
        This could be especially problematic for the     ``WeakKeyDictionary`` when
        combined with dynamic or local     (created in the scope of a function) interfaces,
        since interfaces     are hashed based just on their name and module name.
        See the     linked issue for an example of a resulting ``KeyError``.     Note
        that such potential errors are not new, they are just once     again a possibility.5.1.0
        (2020-04-08)==================- Make ``@implementer(*iface)`` and ``classImplements(cls,
        *iface)``  ignore redundant interfaces. If the class already implements an  interface
        through inheritance, it is no longer redeclared  specifically for *cls*. This
        solves many instances of inconsistent  resolution orders, while still allowing
        the interface to be declared  for readability and maintenance purposes. See
        `issue 199  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/199>`_.-
        Remove all bare ``except:`` statements. Previously, when accessing  special
        attributes such as ``__provides__``, ``__providedBy__``,  ``__class__`` and
        ``__conform__``, this package wrapped such access  in a bare ``except:`` statement,
        meaning that many errors could pass  silently; typically this would result
        in a fallback path being taken  and sometimes (like with ``providedBy()``)
        the result would be  non-sensical. This is especially true when those attributes
        are  implemented with descriptors. Now, only ``AttributeError`` is  caught.
        This makes errors more obvious.  Obviously, this means that some exceptions
        will be propagated  differently than before. In particular, ``RuntimeError``
        raised by  Acquisition in the case of circular containment will now be  propagated.
        Previously, when adapting such a broken object, a  ``TypeError`` would be
        the common result, but now it will be a more  informative ``RuntimeError``.  In
        addition, ZODB errors like ``POSKeyError`` could now be  propagated where
        previously they would ignored by this package.  See `issue 200 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/200>`_.-
        Require that the second argument (*bases*) to ``InterfaceClass`` is  a tuple.
        This only matters when directly using ``InterfaceClass`` to  create new interfaces
        dynamically. Previously, an individual  interface was allowed, but did not
        work correctly. Now it is  consistent with ``type`` and requires a tuple.-
        Let interfaces define custom ``__adapt__`` methods. This implements  the other
        side of the :pep:`246` adaptation protocol: objects being  adapted could already
        implement ``__conform__`` if they know about  the interface, and now interfaces
        can implement ``__adapt__`` if  they know about particular objects. There
        is no performance penalty  for interfaces that do not supply custom ``__adapt__``
        methods.  This includes the ability to add new methods, or override existing  interface
        methods using the new ``@interfacemethod`` decorator.  See `issue 3 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/3>`_.-
        Make the internal singleton object returned by APIs like  ``implementedBy``
        and ``directlyProvidedBy`` for objects that  implement or provide no interfaces
        more immutable. Previously an  internal cache could be mutated. See `issue
        204  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/204>`_.5.0.2
        (2020-03-30)==================- Ensure that objects that implement no interfaces
        (such as direct  subclasses of ``object``) still include ``Interface`` itself
        in  their ``__iro___`` and ``__sro___``. This fixes adapter registry  lookups
        for such objects when the adapter is registered for  ``Interface``. See `issue
        197  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/197>`_.5.0.1
        (2020-03-21)==================- Ensure the resolution order for ``InterfaceClass``
        is consistent.  See `issue 192 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/192>`_.-
        Ensure the resolution order for ``collections.OrderedDict`` is  consistent
        on CPython 2. (It was already consistent on Python 3 and PyPy).- Fix the handling
        of the ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_IRO`` environment  variable. Previously, ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_RO``
        was read, in  contrast with the documentation. See `issue 194  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/194>`_.5.0.0
        (2020-03-19)==================- Make an internal singleton object returned
        by APIs like  ``implementedBy`` and ``directlyProvidedBy`` immutable. Previously,  it
        was fully mutable and allowed changing its ``__bases___``. That  could potentially
        lead to wrong results in pathological corner  cases. See `issue 158  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/158>`_.-
        Support the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable at runtime instead  of just
        at wheel build time. A value of 0 forces the C extensions to  be used (even
        on PyPy) failing if they aren''t present. Any other  value forces the Python
        implementation to be used, ignoring the C  extensions. See `PR 151 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/151>`_.-
        Cache the result of ``__hash__`` method in ``InterfaceClass`` as a  speed
        optimization. The method is called very often (i.e several  hundred thousand
        times during Plone 5.2 startup). Because the hash value never  changes it
        can be cached. This improves test performance from 0.614s  down to 0.575s
        (1.07x faster). In a real world Plone case a reindex  index came down from
        402s to 320s (1.26x faster). See `PR 156  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/156>`_.-
        Change the C classes ``SpecificationBase`` and its subclass  ``ClassProvidesBase``
        to store implementation attributes in their structures  instead of their instance
        dictionaries. This eliminates the use of  an undocumented private C API function,
        and helps make some  instances require less memory. See `PR 154 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/154>`_.-
        Reduce memory usage in other ways based on observations of usage  patterns
        in Zope (3) and Plone code bases.  - Specifications with no dependents are
        common (more than 50%) so    avoid allocating a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` unless
        we need it.  - Likewise, tagged values are relatively rare, so don''t allocate
        a    dictionary to hold them until they are used.  - Use ``__slots___`` or
        the C equivalent ``tp_members`` in more    common places. Note that this removes
        the ability to set arbitrary    instance variables on certain objects.    See
        `PR 155 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/155>`_.  The
        changes in this release resulted in a 7% memory reduction after  loading about
        6,000 modules that define about 2,200 interfaces.  .. caution::     Details
        of many private attributes have changed, and external use     of those private
        attributes may break. In particular, the     lifetime and default value of
        ``_v_attrs`` has changed.- Remove support for hashing uninitialized interfaces.
        This could only  be done by subclassing ``InterfaceClass``. This has generated
        a  warning since it was first added in 2011 (3.6.5). Please call the  ``InterfaceClass``
        constructor or otherwise set the appropriate  fields in your subclass before
        attempting to hash or sort it. See  `issue 157 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/157>`_.-
        Remove unneeded override of the ``__hash__`` method from  ``zope.interface.declarations.Implements``.
        Watching a reindex index  process in ZCatalog with on a Py-Spy after 10k samples
        the time for  ``.adapter._lookup`` was reduced from 27.5s to 18.8s (~1.5x
        faster).  Overall reindex index time shrunk from 369s to 293s (1.26x faster).  See
        `PR 161  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/161>`_.- Make
        the Python implementation closer to the C implementation by  ignoring all
        exceptions, not just ``AttributeError``, during (parts  of) interface adaptation.
        See `issue 163  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/163>`_.-
        Micro-optimization in ``.adapter._lookup`` , ``.adapter._lookupAll``  and
        ``.adapter._subscriptions``: By loading ``components.get`` into  a local variable
        before entering the loop a bytcode "LOAD_FAST 0  (components)" in the loop
        can be eliminated. In Plone, while running  all tests, average speedup of
        the "owntime" of ``_lookup`` is ~5x.  See `PR 167  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/167>`_.-
        Add ``__all__`` declarations to all modules. This helps tools that  do auto-completion
        and documentation and results in less cluttered  results. Wildcard ("*") are
        not recommended and may be affected. See  `issue 153  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/153>`_.-
        Fix ``verifyClass`` and ``verifyObject`` for builtin types like  ``dict``
        that have methods taking an optional, unnamed argument with  no default value
        like ``dict.pop``. On PyPy3, the verification is  strict, but on PyPy2 (as
        on all versions of CPython) those methods  cannot be verified and are ignored.
        See `issue 118  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/118>`_.-
        Update the common interfaces ``IEnumerableMapping``,  ``IExtendedReadMapping``,
        ``IExtendedWriteMapping``,  ``IReadSequence`` and ``IUniqueMemberWriteSequence``
        to no longer  require methods that were removed from Python 3 on Python 3,
        such as  ``__setslice___``. Now, ``dict``, ``list`` and ``tuple`` properly  verify
        as ``IFullMapping``, ``ISequence`` and ``IReadSequence,``  respectively on
        all versions of Python.- Add human-readable ``__str___`` and ``__repr___``
        to ``Attribute``  and ``Method``. These contain the name of the defining interface  and
        the attribute. For methods, it also includes the signature.- Change the error
        strings raised by ``verifyObject`` and  ``verifyClass``. They now include
        more human-readable information  and exclude extraneous lines and spaces.
        See `issue 170  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/170>`_.  ..
        caution:: This will break consumers (such as doctests) that               depended
        on the exact error messages.- Make ``verifyObject`` and ``verifyClass`` report
        all errors, if the  candidate object has multiple detectable violations. Previously
        they  reported only the first error. See `issue  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/171>`_.  Like
        the above, this will break consumers depending on the exact  output of error
        messages if more than one error is present.- Add ``zope.interface.common.collections``,  ``zope.interface.common.numbers``,
        and ``zope.interface.common.io``.  These modules define interfaces based on
        the ABCs defined in the  standard library ``collections.abc``, ``numbers``
        and ``io``  modules, respectively. Importing these modules will make the  standard
        library concrete classes that are registered with those  ABCs declare the
        appropriate interface. See `issue 138  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/138>`_.-
        Add ``zope.interface.common.builtins``. This module defines  interfaces of
        common builtin types, such as ``ITextString`` and  ``IByteString``, ``IDict``,
        etc. These interfaces extend the  appropriate interfaces from ``collections``
        and ``numbers``, and the  standard library classes implement them after importing
        this module.  This is intended as a replacement for third-party packages like  `dolmen.builtins
        <https://pypi.org/project/dolmen.builtins/>`_.  See `issue 138 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/138>`_.-
        Make ``providedBy()`` and ``implementedBy()`` respect ``super``  objects.
        For instance, if class ``Derived`` implements ``IDerived``  and extends ``Base``
        which in turn implements ``IBase``, then  ``providedBy(super(Derived, derived))``
        will return ``[IBase]``.  Previously it would have returned ``[IDerived]``
        (in general, it  would previously have returned whatever would have been returned  without
        ``super``).  Along with this change, adapter registries will unpack ``super``  objects
        into their ``__self___`` before passing it to the factory.  Together, this
        means that ``component.getAdapter(super(Derived,  self), ITarget)`` is now
        meaningful.  See `issue 11 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/11>`_.-
        Fix a potential interpreter crash in the low-level adapter  registry lookup
        functions. See issue 11.- Adopt Python''s standard `C3 resolution order  <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>`_
        to compute the  ``__iro__`` and ``__sro__`` of interfaces, with tweaks to
        support  additional cases that are common in interfaces but disallowed for  Python
        classes. Previously, an ad-hoc ordering that made no  particular guarantees
        was used.  This has many beneficial properties, including the fact that base  interface
        and base classes tend to appear near the end of the  resolution order instead
        of the beginning. The resolution order in  general should be more predictable
        and consistent.  .. caution::     In some cases, especially with complex interface
        inheritance     trees or when manually providing or implementing interfaces,
        the     resulting IRO may be quite different. This may affect adapter     lookup.  The
        C3 order enforces some constraints in order to be able to  guarantee a sensible
        ordering. Older versions of zope.interface did  not impose similar constraints,
        so it was possible to create  interfaces and declarations that are inconsistent
        with the C3  constraints. In that event, zope.interface will still produce
        a  resolution order equal to the old order, but it won''t be guaranteed  to
        be fully C3 compliant. In the future, strict enforcement of C3  order may
        be the default.  A set of environment variables and module constants allows  controlling
        several aspects of this new behaviour. It is possible to  request warnings
        about inconsistent resolution orders encountered,  and even to forbid them.
        Differences between the C3 resolution order  and the previous order can be
        logged, and, in extreme cases, the  previous order can still be used (this
        ability will be removed in  the future). For details, see the documentation
        for  ``zope.interface.ro``.- Make inherited tagged values in interfaces respect
        the resolution  order (``__iro__``), as method and attribute lookup does.
        Previously  tagged values could give inconsistent results. See `issue 190  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/190>`_.-
        Add ``getDirectTaggedValue`` (and related methods) to interfaces to  allow
        accessing tagged values irrespective of inheritance. See  `issue 190  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/190>`_.-
        Ensure that ``Interface`` is always the last item in the ``__iro__``  and
        ``__sro__``. This is usually the case, but if classes that do  not implement
        any interfaces are part of a class inheritance  hierarchy, ``Interface`` could
        be assigned too high a priority.  See `issue 8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/8>`_.-
        Implement sorting, equality, and hashing in C for ``Interface``  objects.
        In micro benchmarks, this makes those operations 40% to 80%  faster. This
        translates to a 20% speed up in querying adapters.  Note that this changes
        certain implementation details. In  particular, ``InterfaceClass`` now has
        a non-default metaclass, and  it is enforced that ``__module__`` in instances
        of  ``InterfaceClass`` is read-only.  See `PR 183 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/183>`_.4.7.2

        (2019-11-11)==================- Drop support for Python 3.4.- Change ``queryTaggedValue``,
        ``getTaggedValue``,  ``getTaggedValueTags`` in interfaces. They now include
        inherited  values by following ``__bases__``. See `PR 144  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/144>`_.  ..

        Make ``setuptools`` a hard dependency of ``setup.py``.  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/13)-
        Change a linear algorithm (O(n)) in ``Components.registerUtility`` and  ``Components.unregisterUtility``
        into a dictionary lookup (O(1)) for  hashable components. This substantially
        improves the time taken to  manipulate utilities in large registries at the

        the "class advice" APIs from ``zope.interface.declarations``:  ``implements``,
        ``implementsOnly``, and ``classProvides``.  In their place,  prefer the equivalent
        class decorators: ``@implementer``,  ``@implementer_only``, and ``@provider``.  Code
        which uses the deprecated  APIs will not work as expected under Py3k.- Remove
        use of ''2to3'' and associated fixers when installing under Py3k.  The code
        is now in a "compatible subset" which supports Python 2.6, 2.7,  and 3.2,
        including PyPy 1.8 (the version compatible with the 2.7 language  spec).-
        Drop explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5 / 3.1.- Add support for PyPy.-
        Add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.- Add

        and ``coverage``).- Add ''setup.py docs'' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).-
        Replace all unittest coverage previously accomplished via doctests with  unittests.  The

        (see PEP 3155 for rationale).  Thanks to Antoine  Pitrou for the patch.3.8.0
        (2011-09-22)==================- New module ``zope.interface.registry``.  This
        is code moved from  ``zope.component.registry`` which implements a basic nonperistent
        component  registry as ``zope.interface.registry.Components``.  This class
        was moved  from ``zope.component`` to make porting systems (such as Pyramid)
        that rely  only on a basic component registry to Python 3 possible without
        needing to  port the entirety of the ``zope.component`` package.  Backwards  compatibility
        import shims have been left behind in ``zope.component``, so  this change
        will not break any existing code.- New ``tests_require`` dependency: ``zope.event``
        to test events sent by  Components implementation.  The ``zope.interface``
        package does not have a  hard dependency on ``zope.event``, but if ``zope.event``
        is importable, it  will send component registration events when methods of
        an instance of  ``zope.interface.registry.Components`` are called.- New interfaces
        added to support ``zope.interface.registry.Components``  addition: ``ComponentLookupError``,
        ``Invalid``, ``IObjectEvent``,  ``ObjectEvent``, ``IComponentLookup``, ``IRegistration``,  ``IUtilityRegistration``,
        ``IAdapterRegistration``,  ``ISubscriptionAdapterRegistration``, ``IHandlerRegistration``,  ``IRegistrationEvent``,
        ``RegistrationEvent``, ``IRegistered``,  ``Registered``, ``IUnregistered``,
        ``Unregistered``,  ``IComponentRegistry``, and ``IComponents``.- No longer

        compare interfaces  from different modules but  with the same names.  N.B.:
        This is a less intrusive / destabilizing fix than the one applied in  3.6.3:  we
        only fix the underlying cmp-alike function, rather than adding  the other

        to Jacob Holm for the patch.- Add support for Python 3.1. Contributors:    Lennart
        Regebro    Martin v Loewis    Thomas Lotze    Wolfgang Schnerring  The 3.1
        support is completely backwards compatible. However, the implements  syntax
        used under Python 2.X does not work under 3.X, since it depends on  how metaclasses
        are implemented and this has changed. Instead it now supports  a decorator
        syntax (also under Python 2.X)::    class Foo:        implements(IFoo)        ...  can
        now also be written::    @implementer(IFoo):    class Foo:        ...  There

        (2007/01/03)==================New Features------------- Refactor the adapter-lookup
        algorithim to make it much simpler and faster.  Also, implement more of the
        adapter-lookup logic in C, making  debugging of application code easier, since
        there is less  infrastructre code to step through.- Treat objects without
        interface declarations as if they  declared that they provide ``zope.interface.Interface``.-
        Add a number of richer new adapter-registration interfaces  that provide greater
        control and introspection.- Add a new interface decorator to zope.interface
        that allows the  setting of tagged values on an interface at definition time
        (see  zope.interface.taggedValue).Bug Fixes---------- A bug in multi-adapter
        lookup sometimes caused incorrect adapters to  be returned.3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)====================-
        Fix packaging bug:  ''package_dir'' must be a *relative* path.3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)====================-
        Packaging change:  suppress inclusion of ''setup.cfg'' in ''sdist'' builds.3.2.0
        (2006-01-05)==================- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface
        package shipped as part of  the Zope 3.2.0 release.3.1.0 (2005-10-03)==================-
        Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of  the
        Zope 3.1.0 release.- Made attribute resolution order consistent with component
        lookup order,  i.e. new-style class MRO semantics.- Deprecate ''isImplementedBy''
        and ''isImplementedByInstancesOf'' APIs in  favor of ''implementedBy'' and
        ''providedBy''.3.0.1 (2005-07-27)==================- Corresponds to the version
        of the zope.interface package shipped as part of  the Zope X3.0.1 release.-
        Fix a bug reported by James Knight, which caused adapter registries  to fail
        occasionally to reflect declaration changes.3.0.0 (2004-11-07)==================-
        Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of  the
        Zope X3.0.0 release.'
