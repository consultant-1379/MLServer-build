A migrations tool\noffers the following functionality:\n\n* Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change\n  the structure of tables and other constructs\n* Provides a system whereby \"migration scripts\" may be constructed;\n  each script indicates a particular series of steps that can \"upgrade\" a\n  target database to a new version, and optionally a series of steps that can\n  \"downgrade\" similarly, doing the same steps in reverse.\n* Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.\n\nThe goals of Alembic are:\n\n* Very open ended and transparent configuration and operation.   A new\n  Alembic environment is generated from a set of templates which is selected\n  among a set of options when setup first occurs. The templates then deposit a\n  series of scripts that define fully how database connectivity is established\n  and how migration scripts are invoked; the migration scripts themselves are\n  generated from a template within that series of scripts. The scripts can\n  then be further customized to define exactly how databases will be\n  interacted with and what structure new migration files should take.\n* Full support for transactional DDL.   The default scripts ensure that all\n  migrations occur within a transaction - for those databases which support\n  this (Postgresql, Microsoft SQL Server), migrations can be tested with no\n  need to manually undo changes upon failure.\n* Minimalist script construction.  Basic operations like renaming\n  tables/columns, adding/removing columns, changing column attributes can be\n  performed through one line commands like alter_column(), rename_table(),\n  add_constraint(). There is no need to recreate full SQLAlchemy Table\n  structures for simple operations like these - the functions themselves\n  generate minimalist schema structures behind the scenes to achieve the given\n  DDL sequence.\n* \"auto generation\" of migrations. While real world migrations are far more\n  complex than what can be automatically determined, Alembic can still\n  eliminate the initial grunt work in generating new migration directives\n  from an altered schema.  The ``--autogenerate`` feature will inspect the\n  current status of a database using SQLAlchemy's schema inspection\n  capabilities, compare it to the current state of the database model as\n  specified in Python, and generate a series of \"candidate\" migrations,\n  rendering them into a new migration script as Python directives. The\n  developer then edits the new file, adding additional directives and data\n  migrations as needed, to produce a finished migration. Table and column\n  level changes can be detected, with constraints and indexes to follow as\n  well.\n* Full support for migrations generated as SQL scripts.   Those of us who\n  work in corporate environments know that direct access to DDL commands on a\n  production database is a rare privilege, and DBAs want textual SQL scripts.\n  Alembic's usage model and commands are oriented towards being able to run a\n  series of migrations into a textual output file as easily as it runs them\n  directly to a database. Care must be taken in this mode to not invoke other\n  operations that rely upon in-memory SELECTs of rows - Alembic tries to\n  provide helper constructs like bulk_insert() to help with data-oriented\n  operations that are compatible with script-based DDL.\n* Non-linear, dependency-graph versioning.   Scripts are given UUID\n  identifiers similarly to a DVCS, and the linkage of one script to the next\n  is achieved via human-editable markers within the scripts themselves.\n  The structure of a set of migration files is considered as a\n  directed-acyclic graph, meaning any migration file can be dependent\n  on any other arbitrary set of migration files, or none at\n  all.  Through this open-ended system, migration files can be organized\n  into branches, multiple roots, and mergepoints, without restriction.\n  Commands are provided to produce new branches, roots, and merges of\n  branches automatically.\n* Provide a library of ALTER constructs that can be used by any SQLAlchemy\n  application. The DDL constructs build upon SQLAlchemy's own DDLElement base\n  and can be used standalone by any application or script.\n* At long last, bring SQLite and its inability to ALTER things into the fold,\n  but in such a way that SQLite's very special workflow needs are accommodated\n  in an explicit way that makes the most of a bad situation, through the\n  concept of a \"batch\" migration, where multiple changes to a table can\n  be batched together to form a series of instructions for a single, subsequent\n  \"move-and-copy\" workflow.   You can even use \"move-and-copy\" workflow for\n  other databases, if you want to recreate a table in the background\n  on a busy system.\n\nDocumentation and status of Alembic is at https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/\n\nThe SQLAlchemy Project\n======================\n\nAlembic is part of the `SQLAlchemy Project <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ and\nadheres to the same standards and conventions as the core project.\n\nDevelopment / Bug reporting / Pull requests\n___________________________________________\n\nPlease refer to the\n`SQLAlchemy Community Guide <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/develop.html>`_ for\nguidelines on coding and participating in this project.\n\nCode of Conduct\n_______________\n\nAbove all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\nPlease see our current Code of Conduct at\n`Code of Conduct <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nAlembic is distributed under the `MIT license\n<https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7b/24/ddce068e2ac9b5581bd58602edb2a1be1b0752e1ff2963c696ecdbe0470d/alembic-1.13.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2009-2023 Michael Bayer.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If sorted intervals are required, simply use the :code:`sorted` keyword as shown below::\n\n  >>> sorted(aniso8601.parse_interval('P1M/1981-04-05'))\n  [datetime.date(1981, 3, 6), datetime.date(1981, 4, 5)]\n\nThe end of an interval is returned as a datetime when required to maintain the resolution specified by a duration, even if the duration start is given as a date::\n\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2014-11-12/PT4H54M6.5S')\n  (datetime.date(2014, 11, 12), datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 12, 4, 54, 6, 500000))\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2007-03-01/P1.5D')\n  (datetime.date(2007, 3, 1), datetime.datetime(2007, 3, 2, 12, 0))\n\nConcise representations are supported::\n\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2020-01-01/02')\n  (datetime.date(2020, 1, 1), datetime.date(2020, 1, 2))\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2007-12-14T13:30/15:30')\n  (datetime.datetime(2007, 12, 14, 13, 30), datetime.datetime(2007, 12, 14, 15, 30))\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2008-02-15/03-14')\n  (datetime.date(2008, 2, 15), datetime.date(2008, 3, 14))\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00')\n  (datetime.datetime(2007, 11, 13, 9, 0), datetime.datetime(2007, 11, 15, 17, 0))\n\nRepeating intervals are supported as well, and return a `generator <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators>`_::\n\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_repeating_interval('R3/1981-04-05/P1D')\n  <generator object _date_generator at 0x7fd800d3b320>\n  >>> list(aniso8601.parse_repeating_interval('R3/1981-04-05/P1D'))\n  [datetime.date(1981, 4, 5), datetime.date(1981, 4, 6), datetime.date(1981, 4, 7)]\n\nRepeating intervals are allowed to go in the reverse direction::\n\n  >>> list(aniso8601.parse_repeating_interval('R2/PT1H2M/1980-03-05T01:01:00'))\n  [datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 5, 1, 1), datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 4, 23, 59)]\n\nUnbounded intervals are also allowed (Python 2)::\n\n  >>> result = aniso8601.parse_repeating_interval('R/PT1H2M/1980-03-05T01:01:00')\n  >>> result.next()\n  datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 5, 1, 1)\n  >>> result.next()\n  datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 4, 23, 59)\n\nor for Python 3::\n\n  >>> result = aniso8601.parse_repeating_interval('R/PT1H2M/1980-03-05T01:01:00')\n  >>> next(result)\n  datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 5, 1, 1)\n  >>> next(result)\n  datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 4, 23, 59)\n\nNote that you should never try to convert a generator produced by an unbounded interval to a list::\n\n  >>> list(aniso8601.parse_repeating_interval('R/PT1H2M/1980-03-05T01:01:00'))\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    File \"/home/nielsenb/Jetfuse/aniso8601/aniso8601/aniso8601/builders/python.py\", line 560, in _date_generator_unbounded\n      currentdate += timedelta\n  OverflowError: date value out of range\n\nTo get the resolution of an ISO 8601 interval string::\n\n  >>> aniso8601.get_interval_resolution('2007-03-01T13:00:00/2008-05-11T15:30:00') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Seconds\n  True\n  >>> aniso8601.get_interval_resolution('2007-03-01T13:00/2008-05-11T15:30') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Minutes\n  True\n  >>> aniso8601.get_interval_resolution('2007-03-01T13/2008-05-11T15') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Hours\n  True\n  >>> aniso8601.get_interval_resolution('2007-03-01/2008-05-11') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Day\n  True\n  >>> aniso8601.get_interval_resolution('2007-03/P1Y') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Month\n  True\n  >>> aniso8601.get_interval_resolution('2007/P1Y') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Year\n  True\n\nAnd for repeating ISO 8601 interval strings::\n\n  >>> aniso8601.get_repeating_interval_resolution('R3/1981-04-05/P1D') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Day\n  True\n  >>> aniso8601.get_repeating_interval_resolution('R/PT1H2M/1980-03-05T01:01:00') == aniso8601.resolution.IntervalResolution.Seconds\n  True\n\nBuilders\n========\n\nBuilders can be used to change the output format of a parse operation. All parse functions have a :code:`builder` keyword argument which accepts a builder class.\n\nTwo builders are included. The :code:`PythonTimeBuilder` (the default) in the :code:`aniso8601.builders.python` module, and the :code:`TupleBuilder` which returns the parse result as a corresponding named tuple and is located in the :code:`aniso8601.builders` module.\n\nInformation on writing a builder can be found in `BUILDERS </BUILDERS.rst>`_.\n\nThe following builders are available as separate projects:\n\n* `RelativeTimeBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/relativetimebuilder>`_ supports parsing to `datetutil relativedelta types <https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/relativedelta.html>`_ for calendar level accuracy\n* `AttoTimeBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/attotimebuilder>`_ supports parsing directly to `attotime attodatetime and attotimedelta types <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/attotime>`_ which support sub-nanosecond precision\n* `NumPyTimeBuilder <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/numpytimebuilder>`_ supports parsing directly to `NumPy datetime64 and timedelta64 types <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.datetime.html>`_\n\nTupleBuilder\n------------\n\nThe :code:`TupleBuilder` returns parse results as `named tuples <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple>`_. It is located in the :code:`aniso8601.builders` module.\n\nDatetimes\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nParsing a datetime returns a :code:`DatetimeTuple` containing :code:`Date` and :code:`Time` tuples . The date tuple contains the following parse components: :code:`YYYY`, :code:`MM`, :code:`DD`, :code:`Www`, :code:`D`, :code:`DDD`. The time tuple contains the following parse components :code:`hh`, :code:`mm`, :code:`ss`, :code:`tz`, where :code:`tz` itself is a tuple with the following components :code:`negative`, :code:`Z`, :code:`hh`, :code:`mm`, :code:`name` with :code:`negative` and :code:`Z` being booleans::\n\n  >>> import aniso8601\n  >>> from aniso8601.builders import TupleBuilder\n  >>>

builder=TupleBuilder)\n  Time(hh='11', mm='31', ss='14', tz=None)\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_time('171819Z', builder=TupleBuilder)\n  Time(hh='17', mm='18', ss='19', tz=Timezone(negative=False, Z=True, hh=None, mm=None, name='Z'))\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_time('17:18:19-02:30', builder=TupleBuilder)\n  Time(hh='17', mm='18', ss='19', tz=Timezone(negative=True, Z=None, hh='02', mm='30', name='-02:30'))\n\nDurations\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nParsing a duration returns a :code:`DurationTuple` containing the following parse components: :code:`PnY`, :code:`PnM`, :code:`PnW`, :code:`PnD`, :code:`TnH`, :code:`TnM`, :code:`TnS`::\n\n  >>> import aniso8601\n  >>> from aniso8601.builders import TupleBuilder\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_duration('P1Y2M3DT4H54M6S', builder=TupleBuilder)\n

TnM=None, TnS=None)\n\nIntervals\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nParsing an interval returns an :code:`IntervalTuple` containing the following parse components: :code:`start`, :code:`end`, :code:`duration`, :code:`start` and :code:`end` may both be datetime or date tuples, :code:`duration` is a duration tuple::\n\n  >>> import aniso8601\n  >>> from aniso8601.builders import TupleBuilder\n  >>> aniso8601.parse_interval('2007-03-01T13:00:00/2008-05-11T15:30:00', builder=TupleBuilder)\n  Interval(start=Datetime(date=Date(YYYY='2007', MM='03', DD='01', Www=None, D=None, DDD=None),

`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.\n\nInside a virtualenv, development dependencies can be installed automatically::\n\n  $ pip install -e .[dev]\n\n`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is used for managing pre-commit hooks::\n\n  $ pre-commit install\n\nTo run the pre-commit hooks manually::\n\n  $ pre-commit run --all-files\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTests can be run using the `unittest testing framework <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_::\n\n  $ python -m unittest discover aniso8601\n\nContributing\n============\n\naniso8601 is an open source project hosted on `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/aniso8601>`_.\n\nAny and all bugs are welcome on our `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/nielsenb/aniso8601/issues>`_.\nOf particular interest are valid ISO 8601 strings that don't parse, or invalid ones that do. At a minimum,\nbug reports should include an example of the misbehaving string, as well as the expected result. Of course\npatches containing unit tests (or fixed bugs) are welcome!\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n* `ISO 8601:2004(E) <http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf>`_ (Caution, PDF link)\n* `Wikipedia article on ISO 8601 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso8601>`_\n* `Discussion on alternative ISO 8601 parsers for Python <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/Q2w4R89Nq1w>`_\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e3/04/e97c12dc034791d7b504860acfcdd2963fa21ae61eaca1c9d31245f812c3/aniso8601-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2021, Brandon Nielsen\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

Here are some numbers.\n\n| Package                                       | Accuracy | Mean per file (ms) | File per sec (est) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |   86 %   |       200 ms       |     5 file/sec     |\n| charset-normalizer                            | **98 %** |     **10 ms**      |    100 file/sec    |\n\n| Package                                       | 99th percentile | 95th percentile | 50th percentile |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |     1200 ms     |     287 ms      |      23 ms      |\n| charset-normalizer                            |     100 ms      |      50 ms      |      5 ms       |\n\nChardet's performance on larger file (1MB+) are very poor. Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can. \n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

Serialization by reference treats\nfunctions and classes as attributes of modules, and pickles them through\ninstructions that trigger the import of their module at load time.\nSerialization by reference is thus limited in that it assumes that the module\ncontaining the function or class is available/importable in the unpickling\nenvironment. This assumption breaks when pickling constructs defined in an\ninteractive session, a case that is automatically detected by `cloudpickle`,\nthat pickles such constructs **by value**.\n\nAnother case where the importability assumption is expected to break is when\ndeveloping a module in a distributed execution environment: the worker\nprocesses may not have access to the said module, for example if they live on a\ndifferent machine than the process in which the module is being developed. By\nitself, `cloudpickle` cannot detect such \"locally importable\" modules and\nswitch to serialization by value; instead, it relies on its default mode, which\nis serialization by reference. However, since `cloudpickle 2.0.0`, one can\nexplicitly specify modules for which serialization by value should be used,\nusing the\n`register_pickle_by_value(module)`/`/unregister_pickle_by_value(module)` API:\n\n```python\n>>> import cloudpickle\n>>> import my_module\n>>> cloudpickle.register_pickle_by_value(my_module)\n>>> cloudpickle.dumps(my_module.my_function)  # my_function is pickled by value\n>>> cloudpickle.unregister_pickle_by_value(my_module)\n>>> cloudpickle.dumps(my_module.my_function)  # my_function is pickled by reference\n```\n\nUsing this API, there is no need to re-install the new version of the module on\nall the worker nodes nor to restart the workers: restarting the client Python\nprocess with the new source code is enough.\n\nNote that this feature is still **experimental**, and may fail in the following\nsituations:\n\n- If the body of a function/class pickled by value contains an `import` statement:\n  ```python\n  >>> def f():\n  >>> ... from another_module import g\n  >>> ... # calling f in the unpickling environment may fail if another_module\n  >>> ... # is unavailable\n  >>> ... return g() + 1\n  ```\n\n- If a function pickled by reference uses a function pickled by value during its execution.\n\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\n- With `tox`, to test run the tests for all the supported versions of\n  Python and PyPy:\n\n      pip install tox\n      tox\n\n  or alternatively for a specific environment:\n\n      tox -e py312\n\n\n- With `pytest` to only run the tests for your current version of\n  Python:\n\n      pip install -r dev-requirements.txt\n      PYTHONPATH='.:tests' pytest\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n`cloudpickle` was initially developed by [picloud.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721022102/http://blog.picloud.com/2013/11/17/picloud-has-joined-dropbox/) and shipped as part of\nthe client SDK.\n\nA copy of `cloudpickle.py` was included as part of PySpark, the Python\ninterface to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Davies Liu, Josh\nRosen, Thom Neale and other Apache Spark developers improved it significantly,\nmost notably to add support for PyPy and Python 3.\n\nThe aim of the `cloudpickle` project is to make that work available to a wider\naudience outside of the Spark ecosystem and to make it easier to improve it\nfurther notably with the help of a dedicated non-regression test suite.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c8/72/42a6570fc61b1f8913529728ad314c7cf5961540728dcad22c33fb2db6b6/cloudpickle-3.0.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2012 now, CloudPickle developers and contributors. .

Colorama makes this work on\nWindows, too, by wrapping ``stdout``, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which\nwould appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the\nappropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,\nColorama does nothing.\n\nThis has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing\ncolored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing\napplications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on\nLinux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling\n``colorama.just_fix_windows_console()`` (since v0.4.6) or ``colorama.init()``\n(all versions, but may have other side-effects – see below).\n\nAn alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows machines, which\nprovides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals. Colorama\nis intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g., maybe your app doesn't\nhave an installer.)\n\nDemo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using\nANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's built in ANSI\nhandling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/ubuntu-demo.png\n    :width: 661\n    :height: 357\n    :alt: ANSI sequences on Ubuntu under gnome-terminal.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/windows-demo.png\n    :width: 668\n    :height: 325\n    :alt: Same ANSI sequences on Windows, using Colorama.\n\nThese screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support ANSI 'dim\ntext'; it looks the same as 'normal text'.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInitialisation\n..............\n\nIf the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work on\nWindows, then run:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\nIf you're on a recent version of Windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr\nare pointing to a Windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration\nswitch to enable Windows' built-in ANSI support.\n\nIf you're on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to\na Windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr`` in a\nmagic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues the\nappropriate Win32 calls to emulate them.\n\nIn all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. Basically the idea is\nthat this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to ANSI escape handling.\n\nIt's safe to call this function multiple times. It's safe to call this function\non non-Windows platforms, but it won't do anything. It's safe to call this\nfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file – it\nwon't do anything to those streams.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more\npotential footguns):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import init\n    init()\n\nThis does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for the\nfollowing differences:\n\n- It's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up with multiple\n  layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.\n\n- Colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,\n  and if it thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and\n  ``sys.stderr`` in a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences\n  before printing them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if\n  you want to write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and\n  let Colorama decide whether they should actually be output. But note that\n  Colorama's heuristic is not particularly clever.\n\n- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various\n  functionality – see below.\n\nTo stop using Colorama before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.\nThis will restore ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to their original values, so that\nColorama is disabled. To resume using Colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it is\ncheaper than calling ``init()`` again (but does the same thing).\n\nMost users should depend on ``colorama >= 0.4.6``, and use\n``just_fix_windows_console``. The old ``init`` interface will be supported\nindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to fix any issues\nwith it, also for backwards compatibility.\n\nColored Output\n..............\n\nCross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama's\nconstant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberately\nrudimentary, see below.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import Fore, Back, Style\n    print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\n    print(Back.GREEN + 'and with a green background')\n    print(Style.DIM + 'and in dim text')\n    print(Style.RESET_ALL)\n    print('back to normal now')\n\n...or simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    print('\\033[31m' + 'some red text')\n    print('\\033[39m') # and reset to default color\n\n...or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ANSI libraries\nsuch as the venerable `Termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_\nthe fabulous `Blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,\nor the incredible `_Rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.\n\nIf you wish Colorama's Fore, Back and Style constants were more capable,\nthen consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate\ncolors, etc, and use Colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert\nthose ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:\n\nSIMILARLY, do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.\nWe are only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, not\nshortcuts like the above to generate ANSI characters.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    from termcolor import colored\n\n    # use Colorama to make Termcolor work on Windows too\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\n    # then use Termcolor for all colored text output\n    print(colored('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red'))\n\nAvailable formatting constants are::\n\n    Fore: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\n    Back: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\n    Style: DIM, NORMAL, BRIGHT, RESET_ALL\n\n``Style.RESET_ALL`` resets foreground, background, and brightness. Colorama will\nperform this reset automatically on program exit.\n\nThese are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard::\n\n    Fore: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\n    Back: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\n\nCursor Positioning\n..................\n\nANSI codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See ``demos/demo06.py`` for\nan example of how to generate them.\n\nInit Keyword Args\n.................\n\n``init()`` accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.\n\ninit(autoreset=False):\n    If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color\n    changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=True)`` will\n    automate that:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from colorama import init\n        init(autoreset=True)\n        print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\n        print('automatically back to default color again')\n\ninit(strip=None):\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether ANSI codes should be\n    stripped from the output. The default behaviour is to strip if on Windows\n    or if output is redirected (not a tty).\n\ninit(convert=None):\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether to convert ANSI codes in the\n    output into win32 calls. The default behaviour is to convert if on Windows\n    and output is to a tty (terminal).\n\ninit(wrap=True):\n    On Windows, Colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``\n    with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their work.\n    If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing\n    ``init(wrap=False)``. The default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset`` or\n    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are True.\n\n    When wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-Windows platforms will\n    continue to work as normal. To do cross-platform colored output, you can\n    use Colorama's ``AnsiToWin32`` proxy directly:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        import sys\n        from colorama import init, AnsiToWin32\n        init(wrap=False)\n        stream = AnsiToWin32(sys.stderr).stream\n\n        # Python 2\n        print >>stream, Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr'\n\n        # Python 3\n        print(Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)\n\nRecognised ANSI Sequences\n.........................\n\nANSI sequences generally take the form::\n\n    ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>\n\nWhere ``<param>`` is an integer, and ``<command>`` is a single letter. Zero or\nmore params are passed to a ``<command>``. If no params are passed, it is\ngenerally synonymous with passing a single zero. No spaces exist in the\nsequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.\n\nThe only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls are::\n\n    ESC [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)\n    ESC [ 1 m       # bright\n    ESC [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)\n    ESC [ 22 m      # normal brightness\n\n    # FOREGROUND:\n    ESC [ 30 m      # black\n    ESC [ 31 m      # red\n    ESC [ 32 m      # green\n    ESC [ 33 m      # yellow\n    ESC [ 34 m      # blue\n    ESC [ 35 m      # magenta\n    ESC [ 36 m      # cyan\n    ESC [ 37 m      # white\n    ESC [ 39 m      # reset\n\n    # BACKGROUND\n    ESC [ 40 m      # black\n    ESC [ 41 m      # red\n    ESC [ 42 m      # green\n    ESC [ 43 m      # yellow\n    ESC [ 44 m      # blue\n    ESC [ 45 m      # magenta\n    ESC [ 46 m      # cyan\n    ESC [ 47 m      # white\n    ESC [ 49 m      # reset\n\n    # cursor positioning\n    ESC [ y;x H     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    ESC [ y;x f     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    ESC [ n A       # move cursor n lines up\n    ESC [ n B       # move cursor n lines down\n    ESC [ n C       # move cursor n characters forward\n    ESC [ n D       # move cursor n characters backward\n\n    # clear the screen\n    ESC [ mode J    # clear the screen\n\n    # clear the line\n    ESC [ mode K    # clear the line\n\nMultiple numeric params to the ``'m'`` command can be combined into a single\nsequence::\n\n    ESC [ 36 ; 45 ; 1 m     # bright cyan text on magenta background\n\nAll other ANSI sequences of the form ``ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>``\nare silently stripped from the output on Windows.\n\nAny other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative\ninitial characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to add\nthem though. Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues on\nGitHub.\n\nStatus & Known Problems\n-----------------------\n\nI've personally only tested it on Windows XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu\n(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.\n\nSome valid ANSI sequences aren't recognised.\n\nIf you're hacking on the code, see `README-hacking.md`_. ESPECIALLY, see the\nexplanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow Colorama to generate new\ntypes of ANSI codes.\n\nSee outstanding issues and wish-list:\nhttps://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues\n\nIf anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,\nI'd love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,\nand would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patch\nor two.\n\n.. _README-hacking.md: README-hacking.md\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright Jonathan Hartley & Arnon Yaari, 2013-2020.

The most common examples are ``console_scripts`` entry points,\nwhich define shell commands by identifying a Python function to run.\n\n*Groups* of entry points, such as ``console_scripts``, point to objects with\nsimilar interfaces. An application might use a group to find its plugins, or\nmultiple groups if it has different kinds of plugins.\n\nThe **entrypoints** module contains functions to find and load entry points.\nYou can install it from PyPI with ``pip install entrypoints``.\n\nTo advertise entry points when distributing a package, see\n`entry_points in the Python Packaging User Guide\n<https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#entry-points>`_.\n\nThe ``pkg_resources`` module distributed with ``setuptools`` provides a way to\ndiscover entrypoints as well, but it contains other functionality unrelated to\nentrypoint discovery, and it does a lot of work at import time.  Merely\n*importing* ``pkg_resources`` causes it to scan the files of all installed\npackages. Thus, in environments where a large number of packages are installed,\nimporting ``pkg_resources`` can be very slow (several seconds).\n\nBy contrast, ``entrypoints`` is focused solely on entrypoint discovery and it\nis faster. Importing ``entrypoints`` does not scan anything, and getting a\ngiven entrypoint group performs a more focused scan.\n\nWhen there are multiple versions of the same distribution in different\ndirectories on ``sys.path``, ``entrypoints`` follows the rule that the first\none wins.  In most cases, this follows the logic of imports.  Similarly,\nEntrypoints relies on ``pip`` to ensure that only one ``.dist-info`` or\n``.egg-info`` directory exists for each installed package.  There is no reliable\nway to pick which of several `.dist-info` folders accurately relates to the\nimportable modules.","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ea/8d/a7121ffe5f402dc015277d2d31eb82d2187334503a011c18f2e78ecbb9b2/entrypoints-0.4.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Thomas Kluyver and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The\n  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType\n  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It\n  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some\n  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source\n  licence <LICENSE>`__.\n| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.\n\n`User documentation <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and\n`developer documentation <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html>`_\nare available at `Read the Docs <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFontTools requires `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`__ 3.8\nor later. We try to follow the same schedule of minimum Python version support as\nNumPy (see `NEP 29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`__).\n\nThe package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can\ninstall it with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip install fonttools\n\nIf you would like to contribute to its development, you can clone the\nrepository from GitHub, install the package in 'editable' mode and\nmodify the source code in place. We recommend creating a virtual\nenvironment, using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__ or\nPython 3 `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ module.\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    # download the source code to 'fonttools' folder\n    git clone https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools.git\n    cd fonttools\n\n    # create new virtual environment called e.g. 'fonttools-venv', or anything you like\n    python -m virtualenv fonttools-venv\n\n    # source the `activate` shell script to enter the environment (Unix-like); to exit, just type `deactivate`\n    . fonttools-venv/bin/activate\n\n    # to activate the virtual environment in Windows `cmd.exe`, do\n    fonttools-venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n\n    # install in 'editable' mode\n    pip install -e .\n\nOptional Requirements\n---------------------\n\nThe ``fontTools`` package currently has no (required) external dependencies\nbesides the modules included in the Python Standard Library.\nHowever, a few extra dependencies are required by some of its modules, which\nare needed to unlock optional features.\nThe ``fonttools`` PyPI distribution also supports so-called \"extras\", i.e. a\nset of keywords that describe a group of additional dependencies, which can be\nused when installing via pip, or when specifying a requirement.\nFor example:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    pip install fonttools[ufo,lxml,woff,unicode]\n\nThis command will install fonttools, as well as the optional dependencies that\nare required to unlock the extra features named \"ufo\", etc.\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/etree.py``\n\n  The module exports a ElementTree-like API for reading/writing XML files, and\n  allows to use as the backend either the built-in ``xml.etree`` module or\n  `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__. The latter is preferred whenever present,\n  as it is generally faster and more secure.\n\n  *Extra:* ``lxml``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ufoLib``\n\n  Package for reading and writing UFO source files; it requires:\n\n  * `fs <https://pypi.org/pypi/fs>`__: (aka ``pyfilesystem2``) filesystem\n    abstraction layer.\n\n  * `enum34 <https://pypi.org/pypi/enum34>`__: backport for the built-in ``enum``\n    module (only required on Python < 3.4).\n\n  *Extra:* ``ufo``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/woff2.py``\n\n  Module to compress/decompress WOFF 2.0 web fonts; it requires:\n\n  * `brotli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brotli>`__: Python bindings of\n    the Brotli compression library.\n\n  *Extra:* ``woff``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/sfnt.py``\n\n  To better compress WOFF 1.0 web fonts, the following module can be used\n  instead of the built-in ``zlib`` library:\n\n  * `zopfli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopfli>`__: Python bindings of\n    the Zopfli compression library.\n\n  *Extra:* ``woff``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/unicode.py``\n\n  To display the Unicode character names when dumping the ``cmap`` table\n  with ``ttx`` we use the ``unicodedata`` module in the Standard Library.\n  The version included in there varies between different Python versions.\n  To use the latest available data, you can install:\n\n  * `unicodedata2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodedata2>`__:\n    ``unicodedata`` backport for Python 3.x updated to the latest Unicode\n    version 15.0.\n\n  *Extra:* ``unicode``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/interpolatable.py``\n\n  Module for finding wrong contour/component order between different masters.\n  It requires one of the following packages in order to solve the so-called\n  \"minimum weight perfect matching problem in bipartite graphs\", or\n  the Assignment problem:\n\n  * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`__: the Scientific Library\n    for Python, which internally uses `NumPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`__\n    arrays and hence is very fast;\n  * `munkres <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres>`__: a pure-Python\n    module that implements the Hungarian or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.\n\n  To plot the results to a PDF or HTML format, you also need to install:\n\n  * `pycairo <https://pypi.org/project/pycairo/>`__: Python bindings for the\n    Cairo graphics library. Note that wheels are currently only available for\n    Windows, for other platforms see pycairo's `installation instructions\n    <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.\n\n  *Extra:* ``interpolatable``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/plot.py``\n\n  Module for visualizing DesignSpaceDocument and resulting VariationModel.\n\n  * `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/pypi/matplotlib>`__: 2D plotting library.\n\n  *Extra:* ``plot``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/symfont.py``\n\n  Advanced module for symbolic font statistics analysis; it requires:\n\n  * `sympy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy>`__: the Python library for\n    symbolic mathematics.\n\n  *Extra:* ``symfont``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/t1Lib.py``\n\n  To get the file creator and type of Macintosh PostScript Type 1 fonts\n  on Python 3 you need to install the following module, as the old ``MacOS``\n  module is no longer included in Mac Python:\n\n  * `xattr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr>`__: Python wrapper for\n    extended filesystem attributes (macOS platform only).\n\n  *Extra:* ``type1``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/removeOverlaps.py``\n\n  Simplify TrueType glyphs by merging overlapping contours and components.\n\n  * `skia-pathops <https://pypi.python.org/pypy/skia-pathops>`__: Python\n    bindings for the Skia library's PathOps module, performing boolean\n    operations on paths (union, intersection, etc.).\n\n  *Extra:* ``pathops``\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/cocoaPen.py`` and ``Lib/fontTools/pens/quartzPen.py``\n\n  Pens for drawing glyphs with Cocoa ``NSBezierPath`` or ``CGPath`` require:\n\n  * `PyObjC <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyobjc>`__: the bridge between\n    Python and the Objective-C runtime (macOS platform only).\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/qtPen.py``\n\n  Pen for drawing glyphs with Qt's ``QPainterPath``, requires:\n\n  * `PyQt5 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5>`__: Python bindings for\n    the Qt cross platform UI and application toolkit.\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/reportLabPen.py``\n\n  Pen to drawing glyphs as PNG images, requires:\n\n  * `reportlab <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab>`__: Python toolkit\n    for generating PDFs and graphics.\n\n- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/freetypePen.py``\n\n  Pen to drawing glyphs with FreeType as raster images, requires:\n\n  * `freetype-py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/freetype-py>`__: Python binding\n    for the FreeType library.\n    \n- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/tables/otBase.py``\n\n  Use the Harfbuzz library to serialize GPOS/GSUB using ``hb_repack`` method, requires:\n  \n  * `uharfbuzz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uharfbuzz>`__: Streamlined Cython\n    bindings for the harfbuzz shaping engine\n    \n  *Extra:* ``repacker``\n\nHow to make a new release\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n1) Update ``NEWS.rst`` with all the changes since the last release. Write a\n   changelog entry for each PR, with one or two short sentences summarizing it,\n   as well as links to the PR and relevant issues addressed by the PR. Do not\n   put a new title, the next command will do it for you.\n2) Use semantic versioning to decide whether the new release will be a 'major',\n   'minor' or 'patch' release. It's usually one of the latter two, depending on\n   whether new backward compatible APIs were added, or simply some bugs were fixed.\n3) Run ``python setup.py release`` command from the tip of the ``main`` branch.\n   By default this bumps the third or 'patch' digit only, unless you pass ``--major``\n   or ``--minor`` to bump respectively the first or second digit.\n   This bumps the package version string, extracts the changes since the latest\n   version from ``NEWS.rst``, and uses that text to create an annotated git tag\n   (or a signed git tag if you pass the ``--sign`` option and your git and Github\n   account are configured for `signing commits <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`__\n   using a GPG key).\n   It also commits an additional version bump which opens the main branch for\n   the subsequent developmental cycle\n4) Push both the tag and commit to the upstream repository, by running the command\n   ``git push --follow-tags``. Note: it may push other local tags as well, be\n   careful.\n5) Let the CI build the wheel and source distribution packages and verify both\n   get uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n6) [Optional] Go to fonttools `Github Releases <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/releases>`__\n   page and create a new release, copy-pasting the content of the git tag\n   message. This way, the release notes are nicely formatted as markdown, and\n   users watching the repo will get an email notification.

[varLib.iup] Added workaround for a Cython bug in ``iup_delta_optimize`` that was\n  leading to IUP tolerance being incorrectly initialised, resulting in sub-optimal deltas\n  (60126435d, cython/cython#5732).\n- [varLib] Added new command-line entry point ``fonttools varLib.avar`` to add an\n  ``avar`` table to an existing VF from axes mappings in a .designspace file (0a3360e52).\n-

participating, allowing sparse masters to contain glyphs for variation purposes other\n  than {H,V}VAR (#3235).\n- [varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in non-default masters as missing, thus not participating\n  in CFF2 delta computation, similarly to how varLib already treats them for gvar (#3234).\n- Added varLib.avarPlanner script to deduce 'correct' avar v1 axis mappings based on\n  glyph average weights (#3223).\n\n4.41.1 (released 2023-07-21)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed perf regression in v4.41.0 by making ``NameRecordVisitor`` only visit\n  tables that do

[fontBuilder] Update setupAvar() to also support avar 2, fixing ``_add_avar()`` call\n  site (#3183).\n- Added new ``voltLib.voltToFea`` submodule (originally Tiro Typeworks' \"Volto\") for\n  converting VOLT OpenType Layout sources to FEA format (#3164).\n\n4.40.0 (released 2023-06-12)\n----------------------------\n\n- Published native binary wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions and platform\n  and architectures currently supported that would benefit from this. They will include\n  precompiled Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to compile them\n  from source. The pure-python wheel and source distribution will continue to be\n  published as always (pip will automatically chose them when no binary wheel is\n  available for the given platform, e.g. pypy). Use ``pip install --no-binary=fonttools fonttools``\n  to expliclity request pip to install from the pure-python source.\n- [designspaceLib|varLib] Add initial support for specifying axis mappings and build\n  ``avar2`` table from those (#3123).\n- [feaLib] Support variable ligature caret position (#3130).\n- [varLib|glyf] Added option to --drop-implied-oncurves; test for impliable oncurve\n  points either before or after rounding (#3146, #3147, #3155, #3156).\n- [TTGlyphPointPen] Don't error with empty contours, simply ignore them (#3145).\n- [sfnt] Fixed str vs bytes remnant of py3 transition in code dealing with de/compiling\n  WOFF metadata (#3129).\n- [instancer-solver] Fixed bug when moving default instance with sparse masters (#3139, #3140).\n- [feaLib] Simplify variable scalars that don’t vary (#3132).\n- [pens] Added filter pen that explicitly emits closing line when lastPt != movePt (#3100).\n- [varStore] Improve optimize algorithm and better document the algorithm (#3124, #3127).\n  Added ``quantization`` option (#3126).\n- Added CI workflow config file for building native binary wheels (#3121).\n- [fontBuilder] Added glyphDataFormat=0 option; raise error when glyphs contain cubic\n  outlines but glyphDataFormat was not explicitly set to 1 (#3113, #3119).\n- [subset] Prune emptied GDEF.MarkGlyphSetsDef and remap indices; ensure GDEF is\n  subsetted before GSUB and GPOS (#3114, #3118).\n- [xmlReader] Fixed issue whereby DSIG table data was incorrectly parsed (#3115, #2614).\n- [varLib/merger] Fixed merging of SinglePos with pos=0 (#3111, #3112).\n- [feaLib] Demote \"Feature has not been defined\" error to a warning when building aalt\n  and referenced feature is empty (#3110).\n- [feaLib] Dedupe multiple substitutions with classes (#3105).\n\n4.39.4 (released 2023-05-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow for sparse masters (#3075)\n- [merge] Handle differing default/nominalWidthX in CFF (#3070)\n- [ttLib] Add missing main.py file to ttLib package (#3088)\n- [ttx] Fix missing composite instructions in XML (#3092)\n- [ttx] Fix split tables option to work on filenames containing '%' (#3096)\n- [featureVars] Process lookups for features other than rvrn last (#3099)\n- [feaLib] support multiple substitution with classes (#3103)\n\n4.39.3 (released 2023-03-28)\n----------------------------\n\n- [sbix] Fixed TypeError when compiling empty glyphs whose imageData is None, regression\n  was introduced in v4.39 (#3059).\n- [ttFont] Fixed AttributeError on python <= 3.10 when opening a TTFont from a tempfile\n  SpooledTemporaryFile, seekable method only added on python 3.11 (#3052).\n\n4.39.2 (released 2023-03-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Fixed regression introduced in 4.39.1 whereby an incomplete 'STAT' table\n  would be built even though a DesignSpace v5 did contain 'STAT' definitions (#3045, #3046).\n\n4.39.1 (released 2023-03-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [avar2] Added experimental support for reading/writing avar version 2 as specified in\n  this draft proposal: https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/avar2.md\n- [glifLib] Wrap underlying XML library exceptions with GlifLibError when parsing GLIFs,\n  and also print the name and path of the glyph that fails to be parsed (#3042).\n- [feaLib] Consult avar for normalizing user-space values in ConditionSets and in\n  VariableScalars (#3042, #3043).\n- [ttProgram] Handle string input to Program.fromAssembly() (#3038).\n- [otlLib] Added a config option to emit GPOS 7 lookups, currently disabled by default\n  because of a macOS bug (#3034).\n- [COLRv1] Added method to automatically compute ClipBoxes (#3027).\n- [ttFont] Fixed getGlyphID to raise KeyError on missing glyphs instead of returning\n  None. The regression was introduced in v4.27.0 (#3032).\n- [sbix] Fixed UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'rawdata' (#3031).\n- [varLib] When building VF, do not overwrite a pre-existing ``STAT`` table that was built\n  with feaLib from FEA feature file. Also, added support for building multiple VFs\n  defined in Designspace v5 from ``fonttools varLib`` script (#3024).\n- [mtiLib] Only add ``Debg`` table with lookup names when ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING``\n  env variable is set (#3023).\n\n4.39.0 (released 2023-03-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- [mtiLib] Optionally add `Debg` debug info for MTI feature builds (#3018).\n- [ttx] Support reading input file from standard input using special `-` character,\n  similar to existing `-o -` option to write output to standard output (#3020).\n- [cython] Prevent ``cython.compiled`` raise AttributeError if cython not installed\n  properly (#3017).\n- [OS/2] Guard against ZeroDivisionError when calculating xAvgCharWidth in the unlikely\n  scenario no glyph has non-zero advance (#3015).\n- [subset] Recompute xAvgCharWidth independently of --no-prune-unicode-ranges,\n  previously the two options were involuntarily bundled together (#3012).\n- [fontBuilder] Add ``debug`` parameter to addOpenTypeFeatures method to add source\n  debugging information to the font in the ``Debg`` private table (#3008).\n- [name] Make NameRecord `__lt__` comparison not fail on Unicode encoding errors (#3006).\n- [featureVars] Fixed bug in ``overlayBox`` (#3003, #3005).\n- [glyf] Added experimental support for cubic bezier curves in TrueType glyf table, as\n  outlined in glyf v1 proposal (#2988):\n  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-cubicOutlines.md\n- Added new qu2cu module and related qu2cuPen, the reverse of cu2qu for converting\n  TrueType quadratic splines to cubic bezier curves (#2993).\n- [glyf] Added experimental support for reading and writing Variable Composites/Components\n  as defined in glyf v1 spec proposal (#2958):\n  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-varComposites.md.\n- [pens]: Added `addVarComponent` method to pen protocols' base classes, which pens can implement\n  to handle varcomponents (by default they get decomposed) (#2958).\n- [misc.transform] Added DecomposedTransform class which implements an affine transformation\n  with separate translate, rotation, scale, skew, and transformation-center components (#2598)\n- [sbix] Ensure Glyph.referenceGlyphName is set; fixes error after dumping and\n  re-compiling sbix table with 'dupe' glyphs (#2984).\n- [feaLib] Be cleverer when merging chained single substitutions into same lookup\n  when they are specified using the inline notation (#2150, #2974).\n- [instancer] Clamp user-inputted axis ranges to those of fvar (#2959).\n- [otBase/subset] Define ``__getstate__`` for BaseTable so that a copied/pickled 'lazy'\n  object gets its own OTTableReader to read from; incidentally fixes a bug while\n  subsetting COLRv1 table containing ClipBoxes on python 3.11 (#2965, #2968).\n- [sbix] Handle glyphs with \"dupe\" graphic type on compile correctly (#2963).\n- [glyf] ``endPointsOfContours`` field should be unsigned! Kudos to behdad for\n  spotting one of the oldest bugs in FT. Probably nobody has ever dared to make\n  glyphs with more than 32767 points... (#2957).\n- [feaLib] Fixed handling of ``ignore`` statements with unmarked glyphs to match\n  makeotf behavior, which assumes the first glyph is marked (#2950).\n- Reformatted code with ``black`` and enforce new code style via CI check (#2925).\n- [feaLib] Sort name table entries following OT spec prescribed order in the builder (#2927).\n- [cu2quPen] Add Cu2QuMultiPen that converts multiple outlines at a time in\n  interpolation compatible way; its methods take a list of tuples arguments\n  that would normally be passed to individual segment pens, and at the end it\n  dispatches the converted outlines to each pen (#2912).\n- [reverseContourPen/ttGlyphPen] Add outputImpliedClosingLine option (#2913, #2914,\n  #2921, #2922, #2995).\n- [gvar] Avoid expanding all glyphs unnecessarily upon compile (#2918).\n- [scaleUpem] Fixed bug whereby CFF2 vsindex was scaled; it should not (#2893, #2894).\n- [designspaceLib] Add DS.getAxisByTag and refactor getAxis (#2891).\n- [unicodedata] map Zmth<->math in ot_tag_{to,from}_script (#1737, #2889).\n- [woff2] Support encoding/decoding OVERLAP_SIMPLE glyf flags (#2576, #2884).\n- [instancer] Update OS/2 class and post.italicAngle when default moved (L4)\n- Dropped support for Python 3.7 which reached EOL, fontTools requires 3.8+.\n- [instancer] Fixed instantiateFeatureVariations logic when a rule range becomes\n  default-applicable (#2737, #2880).\n- [ttLib] Add main to ttFont and ttCollection that just decompile and re-compile the\n  input font (#2869).\n- [featureVars] Insert 'rvrn' lookup at the beginning of LookupList, to work around bug\n  in Apple implementation of 'rvrn' feature which the spec says it should be processed\n  early whereas on macOS 10.15 it follows lookup order (#2140, #2867).\n- [instancer/mutator] Remove 'DSIG' table if present.\n- [svgPathPen] Don't close path in endPath(), assume open unless closePath() (#2089, #2865).\n\n4.38.0 (released 2022-10-21)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib.instancer] Added support for L4 instancing, i.e. moving the default value of\n  an axis while keeping it variable. Thanks Behdad! (#2728, #2861).\n  It's now also possible to restrict an axis min/max values beyond the current default\n  value, e.g. a font wght has min=100, def=400, max=900 and you want a partial VF that\n  only varies between 500 and 700, you can now do that.\n  You can either specify two min/max values (wght=500:700), and the new default will be\n  set to either the minimum or maximum, depending on which one is closer to the current\n  default (e.g. 500 in this case). Or you can specify three values (e.g. wght=500:600:700)\n  to specify the new default value explicitly.\n- [otlLib/featureVars] Set a few Count values so one doesn't need to compile the font\n  to update them (#2860).\n- [varLib.models] Make extrapolation work for 2-master models as well where one master\n  is at the default location (#2843, #2846).\n  Add optional extrapolate=False to normalizeLocation() (#2847, #2849).\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed sub-optimal packing of CFF2 deltas by no longer rounding them to\n  integer (#2838).\n- [scaleUpem] Calculate numShorts in VarData after scale; handle CFF hintmasks (#2840).\n\n4.37.4 (released 2022-09-30)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Keep nameIDs used by CPAL palette entry labels (#2837).\n- [varLib] Avoid negative hmtx values when creating font from variable CFF2 font (#2827).\n- [instancer] Don't prune stat.ElidedFallbackNameID (#2828).\n- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/Blocks to Unicode 15.0 (#2833).\n\n4.37.3 (released 2022-09-20)\n----------------------------\n\n- Fix arguments in calls to (glyf) glyph.draw() and drawPoints(), whereby offset wasn't\n  correctly passed down; this fix also exposed a second bug, where lsb and tsb were not\n  set (#2824, #2825, adobe-type-tools/afdko#1560).\n\n4.37.2 (released 2022-09-15)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Keep CPAL table and don't attempt to prune unused color indices if OT-SVG\n  table is present even if COLR table was subsetted away; OT-SVG may be referencing the\n  CPAL table; for now we assume that's the case (#2814, #2815).\n- [varLib.instancer] Downgrade GPOS/GSUB version if there are no more FeatureVariations\n  after instancing (#2812).\n- [subset] Added ``--no-lazy`` to optionally load fonts eagerly (mostly to ease\n  debugging of table lazy loading, no practical effects) (#2807).\n- [varLib] Avoid building empty COLR.DeltaSetIndexMap with only identity mappings (#2803).\n- [feaLib] Allow multiple value record types (by promoting to the most general format)\n  within the same PairPos subtable; e.g. this allows variable and non variable kerning\n  rules to share the same subtable. This also fixes a bug whereby some kerning pairs\n  would become unreachable while shapiong because of premature subtable splitting (#2772, #2776).\n- [feaLib] Speed up ``VarScalar`` by caching models for recurring master locations (#2798).\n- [feaLib] Optionally cythonize ``feaLib.lexer``, speeds up parsing FEA a bit (#2799).\n- [designspaceLib] Avoid crash when handling unbounded rule conditions (#2797).\n- [post] Don't crash if ``post`` legacy format 1 is malformed/improperly used (#2786)\n- [gvar] Don't be \"lazy\" (load all glyph variations up front) when TTFont.lazy=False (#2771).\n- [TTFont] Added ``normalizeLocation`` method to normalize a location dict from the\n  font's defined axes space (also known as \"user space\") into the normalized (-1..+1)\n  space. It applies ``avar`` mapping if the font contains an ``avar`` table (#2789).\n- [TTVarGlyphSet] Support drawing glyph instances from CFF2 variable glyph set (#2784).\n- [fontBuilder] Do not error when building cmap if there are zero code points (#2785).\n- [varLib.plot] Added ability to plot a variation model and set of accompaning master\n  values corresponding to the model's master locations into a pyplot figure (#2767).\n- [Snippets] Added ``statShape.py`` script to draw statistical shape of a glyph as an\n  ellips (requires pycairo) (baecd88).\n- [TTVarGlyphSet] implement drawPoints natively, avoiding going through\n  SegmentToPointPen (#2778).\n- [TTVarGlyphSet] Fixed bug whereby drawing a composite glyph multiple times, its\n  components would shif; needed an extra copy (#2774).\n\n4.37.1 (released 2022-08-24)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed regression introduced with v4.37.0 while subsetting the VarStore of\n  ``HVAR`` and ``VVAR`` tables, whereby an ``AttributeError: subset_varidxes`` was\n  thrown because an apparently unused import statement (with the side-effect of\n  dynamically binding that ``subset_varidxes`` method to the VarStore class) had been\n  accidentally deleted in an unrelated PR (#2679, #2773).\n- [pens] Added ``cairoPen`` (#2678).\n- [gvar] Read ``gvar`` more lazily by not parsing all of the ``glyf`` table (#2771).\n- [ttGlyphSet] Make ``drawPoints(pointPen)`` method work for CFF fonts as well via\n  adapter pen (#2770).\n\n4.37.0 (released 2022-08-23)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib.models] Reverted PR #2717 which added support for \"narrow tents\" in v4.36.0,\n  as it introduced a regression (#2764, #2765). It will be restored in upcoming release\n  once we found a solution to the bug.\n- [cff.specializer] Fixed issue in charstring generalizer with the ``blend`` operator\n  (#2750, #1975).\n- [varLib.models] Added support for extrapolation (#2757).\n- [ttGlyphSet] Ensure the newly added ``_TTVarGlyphSet`` inherits from ``_TTGlyphSet``\n  to keep backward compatibility with existing API (#2762).\n- [kern] Allow compiling legacy kern tables with more than 64k entries (d21cfdede).\n- [visitor] Added new visitor API to traverse tree of objects and dispatch based\n  on the attribute type: cf. ``fontTools.misc.visitor`` and ``fontTools.ttLib.ttVisitor``. Added ``fontTools.ttLib.scaleUpem`` module that uses the latter to\n  change a font's units-per-em and scale all the related fields accordingly (#2718,\n  #2755).\n\n4.36.0 (released 2022-08-17)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib.models] Use a simpler model that generates narrower \"tents\" (regions, master\n  supports) whenever possible: specifically when any two axes that actively \"cooperate\"\n  (have masters at non-zero positions for both axes) have a complete set of intermediates.\n  The simpler algorithm produces fewer overlapping regions and behaves better with\n  respect to rounding at the peak positions than the generic solver, always matching\n  intermediate masters exactly, instead of maximally 0.5 units off. This may be useful\n  when 100% metrics compatibility is desired (#2218, #2717).\n- [feaLib] Remove warning when about ``GDEF`` not being built when explicitly not\n  requested; don't build one unconditonally even when not requested (#2744, also works\n  around #2747).\n- [ttFont] ``TTFont.getGlyphSet`` method now supports selecting a location that\n  represents an instance of a variable font (supports both user-scale and normalized\n  axes coordinates via the ``normalized=False`` parameter). Currently this only works\n  for TrueType-flavored variable fonts (#2738).\n\n4.35.0 (released 2022-08-15)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otData/otConverters] Added support for 'biased' PaintSweepGradient start/end angles\n  to match latest COLRv1 spec (#2743).\n- [varLib.instancer] Fixed bug in ``_instantiateFeatureVariations`` when at the same\n  time pinning one axis and restricting the range of a subsequent axis; the wrong axis\n  tag was being used in the latter step (as the records' axisIdx was updated in the\n  preceding step but looked up using the old axes order in the following step) (#2733,\n  #2734).\n- [mtiLib] Pad script tags with space when less than 4 char long (#1727).\n- [merge] Use ``'.'`` instead of ``'#'`` in duplicate glyph names (#2742).\n- [gvar] Added support for lazily loading glyph variations (#2741).\n- [varLib] In ``build_many``, we forgot to pass on ``colr_layer_reuse`` parameter to\n  the ``build`` method (#2730).\n- [svgPathPen] Add a main that prints SVG for input text (6df779fd).\n- [cffLib.width] Fixed off-by-one in optimized values; previous code didn't match the\n  code block above it (2963fa50).\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Support reading .designspace and .glyphs files (via optional\n  ``glyphsLib``).\n- Compile some modules with Cython when available and building/installing fonttools\n  from source: ``varLib.iup`` (35% faster), ``pens.momentsPen`` (makes\n  ``varLib.interpolatable`` 3x faster).\n- [feaLib] Allow features to be built for VF without also building a GDEF table (e.g.\n  only build GSUB); warn when GDEF would be needed but isn't requested (#2705, 2694).\n- [otBase] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when uharfbuzz < 0.23.0 and 'repack' method is\n  missing (32aa8eaf). Use new ``uharfbuzz.repack_with_tag`` when available (since\n  uharfbuzz>=0.30.0), enables table-specific optimizations to be performed during\n  repacking (#2724).\n- [statisticsPen] By default report all glyphs (4139d891). Avoid division-by-zero\n  (52b28f90).\n- [feaLib] Added missing required argument to FeatureLibError exception (#2693)\n- [varLib.merge] Fixed error during error reporting (#2689). Fixed undefined\n  ``NotANone`` variable (#2714).\n\n4.34.4 (released 2022-07-07)\n----------------------------\n\n- Fixed typo in varLib/merger.py that causes NameError merging COLR glyphs\n  containing more than 255 layers (#2685).\n\n4.34.3 (released 2022-07-07)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Don't make up bad PS names when no STAT data (#2684)\n\n4.34.2 (released 2022-07-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varStore/subset] fixed KeyError exception to do with NO_VARIATION_INDEX while\n  subsetting varidxes in GPOS/GDEF (a08140d).\n\n4.34.1 (released 2022-07-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- [instancer] When optimizing HVAR/VVAR VarStore, use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=False to avoid\n  including NO_VARIATION_INDEX in AdvWidthMap, RsbMap, LsbMap mappings, which would\n  push the VarIdx width to maximum (4bytes), which is not desirable. This also fixes\n  a hard crash when attempting to subset a varfont after it had been partially instanced\n  with use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=True.\n\n4.34.0 (released 2022-07-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- [instancer] Set RIBBI bits in head and OS/2 table when cutting instances and the\n  subfamily nameID=2 contains strings like 'Italic' or 'Bold' (#2673).\n- [otTraverse] Addded module containing methods for traversing trees of otData tables\n  (#2660).\n- [otTables] Made DeltaSetIndexMap TTX dump less verbose by omitting no-op entries\n  (#2660).\n- [colorLib.builder] Added option to disable PaintColrLayers's reuse of layers from\n  LayerList (#2660).\n- [varLib] Added support for merging multiple master COLRv1 tables into a variable\n  COLR table (#2660, #2328). Base color glyphs of same name in different masters must have\n  identical paint graph structure (incl. number of layers, palette indices, number\n  of color line stops, corresponding paint formats at each level of the graph),\n  but can differ in the variable fields (e.g. PaintSolid.Alpha). PaintVar* tables\n  are produced when this happens and a VarStore/DeltaSetIndexMap is added to the\n  variable COLR table. It is possible for non-default masters to be 'sparse', i.e.\n  omit some of the color glyphs present in the default master.\n- [feaLib] Let the Parser set nameIDs 1 through 6 that were previously reserved (#2675).\n- [varLib.varStore] Support NO_VARIATION_INDEX in optimizer and instancer.\n- [feaLib] Show all missing glyphs at once at end of parsing (#2665).\n- [varLib.iup] Rewrite force-set conditions and limit DP loopback length (#2651).\n  For Noto Sans, IUP time drops from 23s down to 9s, with only a slight size increase\n  in the final font. This basically turns the algorithm from O(n^3) into O(n).\n- [featureVars] Report about missing glyphs in substitution rules (#2654).\n- [mutator/instancer] Added CLI flag to --no-recalc-timestamp (#2649).\n- [SVG] Allow individual SVG documents in SVG OT table to be compressed on uncompressed,\n  and remember that when roundtripping to/from ttx. The SVG.docList is now a list\n  of SVGDocument namedtuple-like dataclass containing an extra ``compressed`` field,\n  and no longer a bare 3-tuple (#2645).\n- [designspaceLib] Check for descriptor types with hasattr() to allow custom classes\n  that don't inherit the default descriptors (#2634).\n- [subset] Enable sharing across subtables of extension lookups for harfbuzz packing\n  (#2626). Updated how table packing falls back to fontTools from harfbuzz (#2668).\n- [subset] Updated default feature tags following current Harfbuzz (#2637).\n- [svgLib] Fixed regex for real number to support e.g. 1e-4 in addition to 1.0e-4.\n  Support parsing negative rx, ry on arc commands (#2596, #2611).\n- [subset] Fixed subsetting SinglePosFormat2 when ValueFormat=0 (#2603).\n\n4.33.3 (released 2022-04-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Fixed typo in ``deepcopyExceptFonts`` method, preventing font\n  references to be transferred (#2600). Fixed another typo in the name of ``Range``\n  dataclass's ``__post_init__`` magic method (#2597).\n\n4.33.2 (released 2022-04-22)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otBase] Make logging less verbose when harfbuzz fails to serialize. Do not exit\n  at the first failure but continue attempting to fix offset overflow error using\n  the pure-python serializer even when the ``USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER`` option was\n  explicitly set to ``True``. This is normal with fonts with relatively large\n  tables, at least until hb.repack implements proper table splitting.\n\n4.33.1 (released 2022-04-22)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otlLib] Put back the ``FONTTOOLS_GPOS_COMPACT_MODE`` environment variable to fix\n  regression in ufo2ft (and thus fontmake) introduced with v4.33.0 (#2592, #2593).\n  This is deprecated and will be removed one ufo2ft gets updated to use the new\n  config setup.\n\n4.33.0 (released 2022-04-21)\n----------------------------\n\n- [OS/2 / merge] Automatically recalculate ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` after merging\n  fonts with ``fontTools.merge`` (#2591, #2538).\n- [misc/config] Added ``fontTools.misc.configTools`` module, a generic configuration\n  system (#2416, #2439).\n  Added ``fontTools.config`` module, a fontTools-specific configuration\n  system using ``configTools`` above.\n  Attached a ``Config`` object to ``TTFont``.\n- [otlLib] Replaced environment variable for GPOS compression level with an\n  equivalent option using the new config system.\n- [designspaceLib] Incremented format version to 5.0 (#2436).\n  Added discrete axes, variable fonts, STAT information, either design- or\n  user-space location on instances.\n  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.split`` module to split a designspace\n  into sub-spaces that interpolate and that represent the variable fonts\n  listed in the document.\n  Made instance names optional and allow computing them from STAT data instead.\n  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.statNames`` module.\n  Allow instances to have the same location as a previously defined STAT label.\n  Deprecated some attributes:\n  ``SourceDescriptor``: ``copyLib``, ``copyInfo``, ``copyGroups``, ``copyFeatures``.\n  ``InstanceDescriptor``: ``kerning``, ``info``; ``glyphs``: use rules or sparse\n  sources.\n  For both, ``location``: use the more explicit designLocation.\n  Note: all are soft deprecations and existing code should keep working.\n  Updated documentation for Python methods and the XML format.\n- [varLib] Added ``build_many`` to build several variable fonts from a single\n  designspace document (#2436).\n  Added ``fontTools.varLib.stat`` module to build STAT tables from a designspace\n  document.\n- [otBase] Try to use the Harfbuzz Repacker for packing GSUB/GPOS tables when\n  ``uharfbuzz`` python bindings are available (#2552). Disable it by setting the\n  \"fontTools.ttLib.tables.otBase:USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER\" config option to ``False``.\n  If the option is set explicitly to ``True`` but ``uharfbuzz`` can't be imported\n  or fails to serialize for any reasons, an error will be raised (ImportError or\n  uharfbuzz errors).\n- [CFF/T2] Ensure that ``pen.closePath()`` gets called for CFF2 charstrings (#2577).\n  Handle implicit CFF2 closePath within ``T2OutlineExtractor`` (#2580).\n\n4.32.0 (released 2022-04-08)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otlLib] Disable GPOS7 optimization to work around bug in Apple CoreText.\n  Always force Chaining GPOS8 for now (#2540).\n- [glifLib] Added ``outputImpliedClosingLine=False`` parameter to ``Glyph.draw()``,\n  to control behaviour of ``PointToSegmentPen`` (6b4e2e7).\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Check for wrong contour starting point (#2571).\n- [cffLib] Remove leftover ``GlobalState`` class and fix calls to ``TopDictIndex()``\n  (#2569, #2570).\n- [instancer] Clear ``AxisValueArray`` if it is empty after instantiating (#2563).\n\n4.31.2 (released 2022-03-22)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] fix instantiation of GPOS SinglePos values (#2555).\n\n4.31.1 (released 2022-03-18)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] fix subsetting OT-SVG when glyph id attribute is on the root ``<svg>``\n  element (#2553).\n\n4.31.0 (released 2022-03-18)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttCollection] Fixed 'ResourceWarning: unclosed file' warning (#2549).\n- [varLib.merger] Handle merging SinglePos with valueformat=0 (#2550).\n- [ttFont] Update glyf's glyphOrder when calling TTFont.setGlyphOrder() (#2544).\n- [ttFont] Added ``ensureDecompiled`` method to load all tables irrespective\n  of the ``lazy`` attribute (#2551).\n- [otBase] Added ``iterSubTable`` method to iterate over BaseTable's children of\n  type BaseTable; useful for traversing a tree of otTables (#2551).\n\n4.30.0 (released 2022-03-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Added debug logger showing the glyph name for which ``gvar`` is built (#2542).\n- [varLib.errors] Fixed undefined names in ``FoundANone`` and ``UnsupportedFormat``\n  exceptions (ac4d5611).\n- [otlLib.builder] Added ``windowsNames`` and ``macNames`` (bool) parameters to the\n  ``buildStatTabe`` function, so that one can select whether to only add one or both\n  of the two sets (#2528).\n- [t1Lib] Added the ability to recreate PostScript stream (#2504).\n- [name] Added ``getFirstDebugName``, ``getBest{Family,SubFamily,Full}Name`` methods (#2526).\n\n4.29.1 (released 2022-02-01)\n----------------------------\n\n- [colorLib] Fixed rounding issue with radial gradient's start/end circles inside\n  one another (#2521).\n- [freetypePen] Handle rotate/skew transform when auto-computing width/height of the\n  buffer; raise PenError wen missing moveTo (#2517)\n\n4.29.0 (released 2022-01-24)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ufoLib] Fixed illegal characters and expanded reserved filenames (#2506).\n- [COLRv1] Don't emit useless PaintColrLayers of lenght=1 in LayerListBuilder (#2513).\n- [ttx] Removed legacy ``waitForKeyPress`` method on Windows (#2509).\n- [pens] Added FreeTypePen that uses ``freetype-py`` and the pen protocol for\n  rasterizating outline paths (#2494).\n- [unicodedata] Updated the script direction list to Unicode 14.0 (#2484).\n  Bumped unicodedata2 dependency to 14.0 (#2499).\n- [psLib] Fixed type of ``fontName`` in ``suckfont`` (#2496).\n\n4.28.5 (released 2021-12-19)\n----------------------------\n\n- [svgPathPen] Continuation of #2471: make sure all occurrences of ``str()`` are now\n  replaced with user-defined ``ntos`` callable.\n- [merge] Refactored code into submodules, plus several bugfixes and improvements:\n  fixed duplicate-glyph-resolution GSUB-lookup generation code; use tolerance in glyph\n  comparison for empty glyph's width; ignore space of default ignorable glyphs;\n  downgrade duplicates-resolution missing-GSUB from assert to warn; added --drop-tables\n  option (#2473, #2475, #2476).\n\n4.28.4 (released 2021-12-15)\n----------------------------\n\n- [merge] Merge GDEF marksets in Lookups properly (#2474).\n- [feaLib] Have ``fontTools feaLib`` script exit with error code when build fails (#2459)\n- [svgPathPen] Added ``ntos`` option to customize number formatting (e.g. rounding) (#2471).\n- [subset] Speed up subsetting of large CFF fonts (#2467).\n- [otTables] Speculatively promote lookups to extension to speed up compilation. If the\n  offset to lookup N is too big to fit in a ushort, the offset to lookup N+1 is going to\n  be too big as well, so we promote to extension all lookups from lookup N onwards (#2465).\n\n4.28.3 (released 2021-12-03)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed bug while subsetting ``COLR`` table, whereby incomplete layer records\n  pointing to missing glyphs were being retained leading to ``struct.error`` upon\n  compiling. Make it so that ``glyf`` glyph closure, which follows the ``COLR`` glyph\n  closure, does not influence the ``COLR`` table subsetting (#2461, #2462).\n- [docs] Fully document the ``cmap`` and ``glyf`` tables (#2454, #2457).\n- [colorLib.unbuilder] Fixed CLI by deleting no longer existing parameter (180bb1867).\n\n4.28.2 (released 2021-11-22)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otlLib] Remove duplicates when building coverage (#2433).\n- [docs] Add interrogate configuration (#2443).\n- [docs] Remove comment about missing “start” optional argument to ``calcChecksum`` (#2448).\n- [cu2qu/cli] Adapt to the latest ufoLib2.\n- [subset] Support subsetting SVG table and remove it from the list of  drop by default tables (#534).\n- [subset] add ``--pretty-svg`` option to pretty print SVG table contents (#2452).\n- [merge] Support merging ``CFF`` tables (CID-keyed ``CFF`` is still not supported) (#2447).\n- [merge] Support ``--output-file`` (#2447).\n- [docs] Split table docs into individual pages (#2444).\n- [feaLib] Forbid empty classes (#2446).\n- [docs] Improve documentation for ``fontTools.ttLib.ttFont`` (#2442).\n\n4.28.1 (released 2021-11-08)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed AttributeError while traversing a color glyph's Paint graph when there is no\n  LayerList, which is optional (#2441).\n\n4.28.0 (released 2021-11-05)\n----------------------------\n\n- Dropped support for EOL Python 3.6, require Python 3.7 (#2417).\n- [ufoLib/glifLib] Make filename-clash checks faster by using a set instead of a list (#2422).\n- [subset] Don't crash if optional ClipList and LayerList are ``None`` (empty) (#2424, 2439).\n- [OT-SVG] Removed support for old deprecated version 1 and embedded color palettes,\n  which were never officially part of the OpenType SVG spec. Upon compile, reuse offsets\n  to SVG documents that are identical (#2430).\n- [feaLib] Added support for Variable Feature File syntax. This is experimental and subject\n  to change until it is finalized in the Adobe FEA spec (#2432).\n- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/ScriptExtensions/Blocks to UnicodeData 14.0 (#2437).\n\n4.27.1 (released 2021-09-23)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otlLib] Fixed error when chained contextual lookup builder overflows (#2404, #2411).\n- [bezierTools] Fixed two floating-point bugs: one when computing `t` for a point\n  lying on an almost horizontal/vertical line; another when computing the intersection\n  point between a curve and a line (#2413).\n\n4.27.0 (released 2021-09-14)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttLib/otTables] Cleaned up virtual GID handling: allow virtual GIDs in ``Coverage``\n  and ``ClassDef`` readers; removed unused ``allowVID`` argument from ``TTFont``\n  constructor, and ``requireReal`` argument in ``TTFont.getGlyphID`` method.\n  Make ``TTFont.setGlyphOrder`` clear reverse glyphOrder map, and assume ``glyphOrder``\n  internal attribute is never modified outside setGlyphOrder; added ``TTFont.getGlyphNameMany``\n  and ``getGlyphIDMany`` (#1536, #1654, #2334, #2398).\n- [py23] Dropped internal use of ``fontTools.py23`` module to fix deprecation warnings\n  in client code that imports from fontTools (#2234, #2399, #2400).\n- [subset] Fix subsetting COLRv1 clip boxes when font is loaded lazily (#2408).\n\n4.26.2 (released 2021-08-09)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otTables] Added missing ``CompositeMode.PLUS`` operator (#2390).\n\n4.26.1 (released 2021-08-03)\n----------------------------\n\n- [transform] Added ``transformVector`` and ``transformVectors`` methods to the\n  ``Transform`` class. Similar to ``transformPoint`` but ignore the translation\n  part (#2386).\n\n4.26.0 (released 2021-08-03)\n----------------------------\n\n- [xmlWriter] Default to ``\"\\n\"`` for ``newlinestr`` instead of platform-specific\n  ``os.linesep`` (#2384).\n- [otData] Define COLRv1 ClipList and ClipBox (#2379).\n- [removeOverlaps/instancer] Added --ignore-overlap-errors option to work around\n  Skia PathOps.Simplify bug (#2382, #2363, google/fonts#3365).\n- NOTE: This will be the last version to support Python 3.6. FontTools will require\n  Python 3.7 or above from the next release (#2350)\n\n4.25.2 (released 2021-07-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [COLRv1] Various changes to sync with the latest CORLv1 draft spec. In particular:\n  define COLR.VarIndexMap, remove/inline ColorIndex struct, add VarIndexBase to ``PaintVar*`` tables (#2372);\n  add reduced-precicion specialized transform Paints;\n  define Angle as fraction of half circle encoded as F2Dot14;\n  use FWORD (int16) for all Paint center coordinates;\n  change PaintTransform to have an offset to Affine2x3;\n- [ttLib] when importing XML, only set sfntVersion if the font has no reader and is empty (#2376)\n\n4.25.1 (released 2021-07-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttGlyphPen] Fixed bug in ``TTGlyphPointPen``, whereby open contours (i.e. starting\n  with segmentType \"move\") would throw ``NotImplementedError``. They are now treated\n  as if they are closed, like with the ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2364, #2366).\n\n4.25.0 (released 2021-07-05)\n----------------------------\n\n- [tfmLib] Added new library for parsing TeX Font Metric (TFM) files (#2354).\n- [TupleVariation] Make shared tuples order deterministic on python < 3.7 where\n  Counter (subclass of dict) doesn't remember insertion order (#2351, #2353).\n- [otData] Renamed COLRv1 structs to remove 'v1' suffix and match the updated draft\n  spec: 'LayerV1List' -> 'LayerList', 'BaseGlyphV1List' -> 'BaseGlyphList',\n  'BaseGlyphV1Record' -> 'BaseGlyphPaintRecord' (#2346).\n  Added 8 new ``PaintScale*`` tables: with/without centers, uniform vs non-uniform.\n  Added ``*AroundCenter`` variants to ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew``: the default\n  versions no longer have centerX/Y, but default to origin.\n  ``PaintRotate``, ``PaintSkew`` and ``PaintComposite`` formats were re-numbered.\n  NOTE: these are breaking changes; clients using the experimental COLRv1 API will\n  have to be updated (#2348).\n- [pointPens] Allow ``GuessSmoothPointPen`` to accept a tolerance. Fixed call to\n  ``math.atan2`` with x/y parameters inverted. Sync the code with fontPens (#2344).\n- [post] Fixed parsing ``post`` table format 2.0 when it contains extra garbage\n  at the end of the stringData array (#2314).\n- [subset] drop empty features unless 'size' with FeatureParams table (#2324).\n- [otlLib] Added ``otlLib.optimize`` module; added GPOS compaction algorithm.\n  The compaction can be run on existing fonts with ``fonttools otlLib.optimize``\n  or using the snippet ``compact_gpos.py``. There's experimental support for\n  compacting fonts at compilation time using an environment variable, but that\n  might be removed later (#2326).\n\n4.24.4 (released 2021-05-25)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset/instancer] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when instantiating a VF that\n  contains GPOS ValueRecords with ``Device`` tables but without the respective\n  non-Device values (e.g. ``XAdvDevice`` without ``XAdvance``). When not\n  explicitly set, the latter are assumed to be 0 (#2323).\n\n4.24.3 (released 2021-05-20)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otTables] Fixed ``AttributeError`` in methods that split LigatureSubst,\n  MultipleSubst and AlternateSubst subtables when an offset overflow occurs.\n  The ``Format`` attribute was removed in v4.22.0 (#2319).\n\n4.24.2 (released 2021-05-20)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttGlyphPen] Fixed typing annotation of TTGlyphPen glyphSet parameter (#2315).\n- Fixed two instances of DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence (#2311).\n\n4.24.1 (released 2021-05-20)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed AttributeError when SinglePos subtable has None Value (ValueFormat 0)\n  (#2312, #2313).\n\n4.24.0 (released 2021-05-17)\n----------------------------\n\n- [pens] Add ``ttGlyphPen.TTGlyphPointPen`` similar to ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2205).\n\n4.23.1 (released 2021-05-14)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fix ``KeyError`` after subsetting ``COLR`` table that initially contains\n  both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset only requested v1 glyphs; we were\n  not pruning the v0 portion of the table (#2308).\n- [colorLib] Set ``LayerV1List`` attribute to ``None`` when empty, it's optional\n  in CORLv1 (#2308).\n\n4.23.0 (released 2021-05-13)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Allow to use ``\\\\UNC`` absolute paths on Windows (#2299, #2306).\n- [varLib.merger] Fixed bug where ``VarLibMergeError`` was raised with incorrect\n  parameters (#2300).\n- [feaLib] Allow substituting a glyph class with ``NULL`` to delete multiple glyphs\n  (#2303).\n- [glyf] Fixed ``NameError`` exception in ``getPhantomPoints`` (#2295, #2305).\n- [removeOverlaps] Retry pathops.simplify after rounding path coordinates to integers\n  if it fails the first time using floats, to work around a rare and hard to debug\n  Skia bug (#2288).\n- [varLib] Added support for building, reading, writing and optimizing 32-bit\n  ``ItemVariationStore`` as used in COLRv1 table (#2285).\n- [otBase/otConverters] Add array readers/writers for int types (#2285).\n- [feaLib] Allow more than one lookahead glyph/class in contextual positioning with\n  \"value at end\" (#2293, #2294).\n- [COLRv1] Default varIdx should be 0xFFFFFFFF (#2297, #2298).\n- [pens] Make RecordingPointPen actually pass on identifiers; replace asserts with\n  explicit ``PenError`` exception (#2284).\n- [mutator] Round lsb for CF2 fonts as well (#2286).\n\n4.22.1 (released 2021-04-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Skip references to named lookups if the lookup block definition\n  is empty, similarly to makeotf. This also fixes an ``AttributeError`` while\n  generating ``aalt`` feature (#2276, #2277).\n- [subset] Fixed bug with ``--no-hinting`` implementation for Device tables (#2272,\n  #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping Device tables if no-hinting was\n  requested, but some Device tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000) are also used to encode\n  variation indices and need to be retained.\n- [otBase] Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when decompiling ``MVAR``\n  table with ``lazy=True`` (#2273, #2274).\n- [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified ``GlyphCoordinates`` and\n  ``TupleVariation`` classes, use ``bytearray`` where possible, refactored\n  phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30% speedup in total time\n  of loading master ttfs, building gvar, and saving (#2261, #2266).\n- [subset] Fixed ``AssertionError`` while pruning unused CPAL palettes when\n  ``0xFFFF`` is present (#2257, #2259).\n\n4.22.0 (released 2021-04-01)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst, LigatureSubst,\n  AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).\n  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!\n- [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite as a tuple\n  subclass (#2201).\n- [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib (#2209).\n- [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error accumulation from\n  multiple deltas (#2214)\n- [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly terms (#2223, #2226)\n- [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)\n- [varLib/otlLib] Allow merging into VariationFont without first saving GPOS\n  PairPos2 (#2229)\n- [subset] Improve PairPosFormat2 subsetting (#2221)\n- [ttLib] TTFont.save: create file on disk as late as possible (#2253)\n- [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators LanguageGroup and ExpansionFactor\n  (#2249)\n  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!\n\n4.21.1 (released 2021-02-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [pens] Reverted breaking change that turned ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen``\n  into abstract base classes (#2164, #2198).\n\n4.21.0 (released 2021-02-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Indent anchor statements in ``asFea()`` to make them more legible and\n  diff-able (#2193).\n- [pens] Turn ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen`` into abstract base classes\n  (#2164).\n- [feaLib] Added support for parsing and building ``STAT`` table from AFDKO feature\n  files (#2039).\n- [instancer] Added option to update name table of generated instance using ``STAT``\n  table's axis values (#2189).\n- [bezierTools] Added functions to compute bezier point-at-time, as well as line-line,\n  curve-line and curve-curve intersections (#2192).\n\n4.20.0 (released 2021-02-15)\n----------------------------\n\n- [COLRv1] Added ``unbuildColrV1`` to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to raw json-able\n  data structure; it does the reverse of ``buildColrV1`` (#2171).\n- [feaLib] Allow ``sub X by NULL`` sequence to delete a glyph (#2170).\n- [arrayTools] Fixed ``Vector`` division (#2173).\n- [COLRv1] Define new ``PaintSweepGradient`` (#2172).\n- [otTables] Moved ``Paint.Format`` enum class outside of ``Paint`` class definition,\n  now named ``PaintFormat``. It was clashing with paint instance ``Format`` attribute\n  and thus was breaking lazy load of COLR table which relies on magic ``__getattr__``\n  (#2175).\n- [COLRv1] Replace hand-coded builder functions with otData-driven dynamic\n  implementation (#2181).\n- [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats (#2181).\n- [subset] Added support for subsetting COLR v1 and CPAL tables (#2174, #2177).\n- [fontBuilder] Allow ``setupFvar`` to optionally take ``designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor``\n  objects. Added new ``setupAvar`` method. Support localised names for axes and\n  named instances (#2185).\n\n4.19.1 (released 2021-01-28)\n----------------------------\n\n- [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now stays an off-curve\n  point after compression.\n\n4.19.0 (released 2021-01-25)\n----------------------------\n\n- [codecs] Handle ``errors`` parameter different from 'strict' for the custom\n  extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).\n- [featureVars] Raise better error message when a script is missing the required\n  default language system (#2154).\n- [COLRv1] Avoid abrupt change caused by rounding ``PaintRadialGradient.c0`` when\n  the start circle almost touches the end circle's perimeter (#2148).\n- [COLRv1] Support building unlimited lists of paints as 255-ary trees of\n  ``PaintColrLayers`` tables (#2153).\n- [subset] Prune redundant format-12 cmap subtables when all non-BMP characters\n  are dropped (#2146).\n- [basePen] Raise ``MissingComponentError`` instead of bare ``KeyError`` when a\n  referenced component is missing (#2145).\n\n4.18.2 (released 2020-12-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [COLRv1] Implemented ``PaintTranslate`` paint format (#2129).\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed unbound local variable error (#1787).\n- [otlLib] Don't crash when creating OpenType class definitions if some glyphs\n  occur more than once (#2125).\n\n4.18.1 (released 2020-12-09)\n----------------------------\n\n- [colorLib] Speed optimization for ``LayerV1ListBuilder`` (#2119).\n- [mutator] Fixed missing tab in ``interpolate_cff2_metrics`` (0957dc7a).\n\n4.18.0 (released 2020-12-04)\n----------------------------\n\n- [COLRv1] Update to latest draft: added ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew`` (#2118).\n- [woff2] Support new ``brotlicffi`` bindings for PyPy (#2117).\n- [glifLib] Added ``expectContentsFile`` parameter to ``GlyphSet``, for use when\n  reading existing UFOs, to comply with the specification stating that a\n  ``contents.plist`` file must exist in a glyph set (#2114).\n- [subset] Allow ``LangSys`` tags in ``--layout-scripts`` option (#2112). For example:\n  ``--layout-scripts=arab.dflt,arab.URD,latn``; this will keep ``DefaultLangSys``\n  and ``URD`` language for ``arab`` script, and all languages for ``latn`` script.\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow UFOs to be checked; report open paths, non existant\n  glyphs; add a ``--json`` option to produce a machine-readable list of\n  incompatibilities\n- [pens] Added ``QuartzPen`` to create ``CGPath`` from glyph outlines on macOS.\n  Requires pyobjc (#2107).\n- [feaLib] You can export ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING=1`` to enable feature file\n  debugging info stored in ``Debg`` table (#2106).\n- [otlLib] Build more efficient format 1 and format 2 contextual lookups whenever\n  possible (#2101).\n\n4.17.1 (released 2020-11-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0 when building COLR v0 table; when color\n  layers are stored in UFO lib plist, we can't distinguish tuples from lists so\n  we need to accept either types (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).\n\n4.17.0 (released 2020-11-12)\n----------------------------\n\n- [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft ``COLR`` v1 spec (#2092).\n- [svgLib] Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not separated\n  by space or comma (#2094).\n- [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing', if the default glyph is\n  not empty (#2082).\n- [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup location for ``Debg`` if ``Builder.buildLookups_``\n  has cooperated (#2065, #2067).\n- [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).\n- [varLib] Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).\n- Add HashPointPen adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of a glyph\n  can be computed, which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).\n\n4.16.1 (released 2020-10-05)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib.instancer] Fixed ``TypeError`` exception when instantiating a VF with\n  a GSUB table 1.1 in which ``FeatureVariations`` attribute is present but set to\n  ``None`` -- indicating that optional ``FeatureVariations`` is missing (#2077).\n- [glifLib] Make ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of the ``point`` element required\n  even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful ``GlifLibError``\n  message when that happens (#2075).\n\n4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)\n----------------------------\n\n- [removeOverlaps] Added new module and ``removeOverlaps`` function that merges\n  overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the\n  `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.\n  Note that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).\n- [varLib.instancer] Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.\n  The ``overlap`` option in ``instantiateVariableFont`` now takes an ``OverlapMode``\n  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS, 1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2: REMOVE.\n  The latter is equivalent to calling ``removeOverlaps`` on the generated static\n  instance. The option continues to accept ``bool`` value for backward compatibility.\n\n\n4.15.0 (released 2020-09-21)\n----------------------------\n\n- [plistlib] Added typing annotations to plistlib module. Set up mypy static\n  typechecker to run automatically on CI (#2061).\n- [ttLib] Implement private ``Debg`` table, a reverse-DNS namespaced JSON dict.\n- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the ``Debg`` table with the original\n  lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination (if any),\n  and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx output for\n  a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).\n- [sfnt] Disabled checksum checking by default in ``SFNTReader`` (#2058).\n- [Docs] Document ``mtiLib`` module (#2027).\n- [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour node count and operation type\n  of each node (#2054).\n- [ttLib] Added API to register custom table packer/unpacker classes (#2055).\n\n4.14.0 (released 2020-08-19)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).\n- [Docs] Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).\n- [ttLib] Fixed 21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation (#2044,\n  #2045).\n- [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point (81d0042a).\n- [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether the\n  optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).\n- [Snippets] Added snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF (#2030).\n- [otlLib] Generate GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where appropriate\n  (#2016).\n\n4.13.0 (released 2020-07-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib; refactored\n  some common code (#2004, #2007).\n- [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).\n- [glifLib] Fixed bug with some UFO .glif filenames clashing on case-insensitive\n  filesystems (#2001, #2002).\n- [colorLib] Updated COLRv1 implementation following changes in the draft spec:\n  (#2008, googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec#24).\n\n4.12.1 (released 2020-06-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed error in ``addMultilingualName`` with one-character names.\n  Only attempt to recovered malformed UTF-16 data from a ``bytes`` string,\n  not from unicode ``str`` (#1997, #1998).\n\n4.12.0 (released 2020-06-09)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otlLib/varLib] Ensure that the ``AxisNameID`` in the ``STAT`` and ``fvar``\n  tables is grater than 255 as per OpenType spec (#1985, #1986).\n- [docs] Document more modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``filenames``,\n  ``fixedTools``, ``intTools``, ``loggingTools``, ``macCreatorType``, ``macRes``,\n  ``plistlib`` (#1981).\n- [OS/2] Don't calculate whole sets of unicode codepoints, use faster and more memory\n  efficient ranges and bisect lookups (#1984).\n- [voltLib] Support writing back abstract syntax tree as VOLT data (#1983).\n- [voltLib] Accept DO_NOT_TOUCH_CMAP keyword (#1987).\n- [subset/merge] Fixed a namespace clash involving a private helper class (#1955).\n\n4.11.0 (released 2020-05-28)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Introduced ``includeDir`` parameter on Parser and IncludingLexer to\n  explicitly specify the directory to search when ``include()`` statements are\n  encountered (#1973).\n- [ufoLib] Silently delete duplicate glyphs within the same kerning group when reading\n  groups (#1970).\n- [ttLib] Set version of COLR table when decompiling COLRv1 (commit 9d8a7e2).\n\n4.10.2 (released 2020-05-20)\n----------------------------\n\n- [sfnt] Fixed ``NameError: SimpleNamespace`` while reading TTC header. The regression\n  was introduced with 4.10.1 after removing ``py23`` star import.\n\n4.10.1 (released 2020-05-19)\n----------------------------\n\n- [sfnt] Make ``SFNTReader`` pickleable even when TTFont is loaded with lazy=True\n  option and thus keeps a reference to an external file (#1962, #1967).\n- [feaLib.ast] Restore backward compatibility (broken in 4.10 with #1905) for\n  ``ChainContextPosStatement`` and ``ChainContextSubstStatement`` classes.\n  Make them accept either list of lookups or list of lists of lookups (#1961).\n- [docs] Document some modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``arrayTools``,\n  ``bezierTools`` ``cliTools`` and ``eexec`` (#1956).\n- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Fixed ``findMultilingualName()`` when name record's ``string`` is\n  encoded as bytes sequence (#1963).\n\n4.10.0 (released 2020-05-15)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Allow feature variations to be active across the entire space (#1957).\n- [ufoLib] Added support for ``formatVersionMinor`` in UFO's ``fontinfo.plist`` and for\n  ``formatMinor`` attribute in GLIF file as discussed in unified-font-object/ufo-spec#78.\n  No changes in reading or writing UFOs until an upcoming (non-0) minor update of the\n  UFO specification is published (#1786).\n- [merge] Fixed merging fonts with different versions of ``OS/2`` table (#1865, #1952).\n- [subset] Fixed ``AttributeError`` while subsetting ``ContextSubst`` and ``ContextPos``\n  Format 3 subtable (#1879, #1944).\n- [ttLib.table._m_e_t_a] if data happens to be ascii, emit comment in TTX (#1938).\n- [feaLib] Support multiple lookups per glyph position (#1905).\n- [psCharStrings] Use inheritance to avoid repeated code in initializer (#1932).\n- [Doc] Improved documentation for the following modules: ``afmLib`` (#1933), ``agl``\n  (#1934), ``cffLib`` (#1935), ``cu2qu`` (#1937), ``encodings`` (#1940), ``feaLib``\n  (#1941), ``merge`` (#1949).\n- [Doc] Split off developer-centric info to new page, making front page of docs more\n  user-focused. List all utilities and sub-modules with brief descriptions.\n  Make README more concise and focused (#1914).\n- [otlLib] Add function to build STAT table from high-level description (#1926).\n- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Add ``findMultilingualName()`` method (#1921).\n- [unicodedata] Update ``RTL_SCRIPTS`` for Unicode 13.0 (#1925).\n- [gvar] Sort ``gvar`` XML output by glyph name, not glyph order (#1907, #1908).\n- [Doc] Added help options to ``fonttools`` command line tool (#1913, #1920).\n  Ensure all fonttools CLI tools have help documentation (#1948).\n- [ufoLib] Only write fontinfo.plist when there actually is content (#1911).\n\n4.9.0 (released 2020-04-29)\n---------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed subsetting of FeatureVariations table. The subsetter no longer drops\n  FeatureVariationRecords that have empty substitutions as that will keep the search\n  going and thus change the logic. It will only drop empty records that occur at the\n  end of the FeatureVariationRecords array (#1881).\n- [subset] Remove FeatureVariations table and downgrade GSUB/GPOS to version 0x10000\n  when FeatureVariations contain no FeatureVariationRecords after subsetting (#1903).\n- [agl] Add support for legacy Adobe Glyph List of glyph names in ``fontTools.agl``\n  (#1895).\n- [feaLib] Ignore superfluous script statements (#1883).\n- [feaLib] Hide traceback by default on ``fonttools feaLib`` command line.\n  Use ``--traceback`` option to show (#1898).\n- [feaLib] Check lookup index in chaining sub/pos lookups and print better error\n  message (#1896, #1897).\n- [feaLib] Fix building chained alt substitutions (#1902).\n- [Doc] Included all fontTools modules in the sphinx-generated documentation, and\n  published it to ReadTheDocs for continuous documentation of the fontTools project\n  (#1333). Check it out at https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/. Thanks to Chris Simpkins!\n- [transform] The ``Transform`` class is now subclass of ``typing.NamedTuple``. No\n  change in functionality (#1904).\n\n\n4.8.1 (released 2020-04-17)\n---------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Fixed ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' has no attribute 'getAlternateGlyphs'``\n  when ``aalt`` feature references a chain contextual substitution lookup\n  (googlefonts/fontmake#648, #1878).\n\n4.8.0 (released 2020-04-16)\n---------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] If Parser is initialized without a ``glyphNames`` parameter, it cannot\n  distinguish between a glyph name containing an hyphen, or a range of glyph names;\n  instead of raising an error, it now interprets them as literal glyph names, while\n  also outputting a logging warning to alert user about the ambiguity (#1768, #1870).\n- [feaLib] When serializing AST to string, emit spaces around hyphens that denote\n  ranges. Also, fixed an issue with CID ranges when round-tripping AST->string->AST\n  (#1872).\n- [Snippets/otf2ttf] In otf2ttf.py script update LSB in hmtx to match xMin (#1873).\n- [colorLib] Added experimental support for building ``COLR`` v1 tables as per\n  the `colr-gradients-spec <https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/blob/main/colr-gradients-spec.md>`__\n  draft proposal. **NOTE**: both the API and the XML dump of ``COLR`` v1 are\n  susceptible to change while the proposal is being discussed and formalized (#1822).\n\n4.7.0 (released 2020-04-03)\n---------------------------\n\n- [cu2qu] Added ``fontTools.cu2qu`` package, imported from the original\n  `cu2qu <https://github.com/googlefonts/cu2qu>`__ project. The ``cu2qu.pens`` module\n  was moved to ``fontTools.pens.cu2quPen``. The optional cu2qu extension module\n  can be compiled by installing `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__ before installing\n  fonttools from source (i.e. git repo or sdist tarball). The wheel package that\n  is published on PyPI (i.e. the one ``pip`` downloads, unless ``--no-binary``\n  option is used), will continue to be pure-Python for now (#1868).\n\n4.6.0 (released 2020-03-24)\n---------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Added support for building variable ``BASE`` table version 1.1 (#1858).\n- [CPAL] Added ``fromRGBA`` method to ``Color`` class (#1861).\n\n\n4.5.0 (released 2020-03-20)\n---------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Added ``add{Axis,Source,Instance,Rule}Descriptor`` methods to\n  ``DesignSpaceDocument`` class, to initialize new descriptor objects using keyword\n  arguments, and at the same time append them to the current document (#1860).\n- [unicodedata] Update to Unicode 13.0 (#1859).\n\n4.4.3 (released 2020-03-13)\n---------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Always build ``gvar`` table for TrueType-flavored Variable Fonts,\n  even if it contains no variation data. The table is required according to\n  the OpenType spec (#1855, #1857).\n\n4.4.2 (released 2020-03-12)\n---------------------------\n\n- [ttx] Annotate ``LookupFlag`` in XML dump with comment explaining what bits\n  are set and what they mean (#1850).\n- [feaLib] Added more descriptive message to ``IncludedFeaNotFound`` error (#1842).\n\n4.4.1 (released 2020-02-26)\n---------------------------\n\n- [woff2] Skip normalizing ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables if these are missing from\n  a font (e.g. in NotoColorEmoji using ``CBDT/CBLC`` tables).\n- [timeTools] Use non-localized date parsing in ``timestampFromString``, to fix\n  error when non-English ``LC_TIME`` locale is set (#1838, #1839).\n- [fontBuilder] Make sure the CFF table generated by fontBuilder can be used by varLib\n  without having to compile and decompile the table first. This was breaking in\n  converting the CFF table to CFF2 due to some unset attributes (#1836).\n\n4.4.0 (released 2020-02-18)\n---------------------------\n\n- [colorLib] Added ``fontTools.colorLib.builder`` module, initially with ``buildCOLR``\n  and ``buildCPAL`` public functions. More color font formats will follow (#1827).\n- [fontBuilder] Added ``setupCOLR`` and ``setupCPAL`` methods (#1826).\n- [ttGlyphPen] Quantize ``GlyphComponent.transform`` floats to ``F2Dot14`` to fix\n  round-trip issue when computing bounding boxes of transformed components (#1830).\n- [glyf] If a component uses reference points (``firstPt`` and ``secondPt``) for\n  alignment (instead of X and Y offsets), compute the effective translation offset\n  *after* having applied any transform (#1831).\n- [glyf] When all glyphs have zero contours, compile ``glyf`` table data as a single\n  null byte in order to pass validation by OTS and Windows (#1829).\n- [feaLib] Parsing feature code now ensures that referenced glyph names are part of\n  the known glyph set, unless a glyph set was not provided.\n- [varLib] When filling in the default axis value for a missing location of a source or\n  instance, correctly map the value forward.\n- [varLib] The avar table can now contain mapping output values that are greater than\n  OR EQUAL to the preceeding value, as the avar specification allows this.\n- [varLib] The errors of the module are now ordered hierarchically below VarLibError.\n  See #1821.\n\n4.3.0 (released 2020-02-03)\n---------------------------\n\n- [EBLC/CBLC] Fixed incorrect padding length calculation for Format 3 IndexSubTable\n  (#1817, #1818).\n- [varLib] Fixed error when merging OTL tables and TTFonts were loaded as ``lazy=True``\n  (#1808, #1809).\n- [varLib] Allow to use master fonts containing ``CFF2`` table when building VF (#1816).\n- [ttLib] Make ``recalcBBoxes`` option work also with ``CFF2`` table (#1816).\n- [feaLib] Don't reset ``lookupflag`` in lookups defined inside feature blocks.\n  They will now inherit the current ``lookupflag`` of the feature. This is what\n  Adobe ``makeotf`` also does in this case (#1815).\n- [feaLib] Fixed bug with mixed single/multiple substitutions. If a single substitution\n  involved a glyph class, we were incorrectly using only the first glyph in the class\n  (#1814).\n\n4.2.5 (released 2020-01-29)\n---------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Do not fail on duplicate multiple substitutions, only warn (#1811).\n- [subset] Optimize SinglePos subtables to Format 1 if all ValueRecords are the same\n  (#1802).\n\n4.2.4 (released 2020-01-09)\n---------------------------\n\n- [unicodedata] Update RTL_SCRIPTS for Unicode 11 and 12.\n\n4.2.3 (released 2020-01-07)\n---------------------------\n\n- [otTables] Fixed bug when splitting `MarkBasePos` subtables as offsets overflow.\n  The mark class values in the split subtable were not being updated, leading to\n  invalid mark-base attachments (#1797, googlefonts/noto-source#145).\n- [feaLib] Only log a warning instead of error when features contain duplicate\n  substitutions (#1767).\n- [glifLib] Strip XML comments when parsing with lxml (#1784, #1785).\n\n4.2.2 (released 2019-12-12)\n---------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed issue with subsetting FeatureVariations table when the index\n  of features changes as features get dropped. The feature index need to be\n  remapped to point to index of the remaining features (#1777, #1782).\n- [fontBuilder] Added `addFeatureVariations` method to `FontBuilder` class. This\n  is a shorthand for calling `featureVars.addFeatureVariations` on the builder's\n  TTFont object (#1781).\n- [glyf] Fixed the flags bug in glyph.drawPoints() like we did for glyph.draw()\n  (#1771, #1774).\n\n4.2.1 (released 2019-12-06)\n---------------------------\n\n- [glyf] Use the ``flagOnCurve`` bit mask in ``glyph.draw()``, so that we ignore\n  the ``overlap`` flag that may be set when instantiating variable fonts (#1771).\n\n4.2.0 (released 2019-11-28)\n---------------------------\n\n- [pens] Added the following pens:\n\n  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPen``: filter pen that rounds coordinates and components'\n    offsets to integer;\n  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPointPen``: like the above, but using PointPen protocol.\n  * ``filterPen.FilterPointPen``: base class for filter point pens;\n  * ``transformPen.TransformPointPen``: filter point pen to apply affine transform;\n  * ``recordingPen.RecordingPointPen``: records and replays point-pen commands.\n\n- [ttGlyphPen] Always round float coordinates and component offsets to integers\n  (#1763).\n- [ufoLib] When converting kerning groups from UFO2 to UFO3, avoid confusing\n  groups with the same name as one of the glyphs (#1761, #1762,\n  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#98).\n\n4.1.0 (released 2019-11-18)\n---------------------------\n\n- [instancer] Implemented restricting axis ranges (level 3 partial instancing).\n  You can now pass ``{axis_tag: (min, max)}`` tuples as input to the\n  ``instantiateVariableFont`` function. Note that changing the default axis\n  position is not supported yet. The command-line script also accepts axis ranges\n  in the form of colon-separated float values, e.g. ``wght=400:700`` (#1753, #1537).\n- [instancer] Never drop STAT ``DesignAxis`` records, but only prune out-of-range\n  ``AxisValue`` records.\n- [otBase/otTables] Enforce that VarStore.RegionAxisCount == fvar.axisCount, even\n  when regions list is empty to appease OTS < v8.0 (#1752).\n- [designspaceLib] Defined new ``processing`` attribute for ``<rules>`` element,\n  with values \"first\" or \"last\", plus other editorial changes to DesignSpace\n  specification. Bumped format version to 4.1 (#1750).\n- [varLib] Improved error message when masters' glyph orders do not match (#1758,\n  #1759).\n- [featureVars] Allow to specify custom feature tag in ``addFeatureVariations``;\n  allow said feature to already exist, in which case we append new lookup indices\n  to existing features. Implemented ``<rules>`` attribute ``processing`` according to\n  DesignSpace specification update in #1750. Depending on this flag, we generate\n  either an 'rvrn' (always processed first) or a 'rclt' feature (follows lookup order,\n  therefore last) (#1747, #1625, #1371).\n- [ttCollection] Added support for context manager auto-closing via ``with`` statement\n  like with ``TTFont`` (#1751).\n- [unicodedata] Require unicodedata2 >= 12.1.0.\n- [py2.py3] Removed yet more PY2 vestiges (#1743).\n- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed issue when comparing NameRecords with different string types (#1742).\n- [fixedTools] Changed ``fixedToFloat`` to not do any rounding but simply return\n  ``value / (1 << precisionBits)``. Added ``floatToFixedToStr`` and\n  ``strToFixedToFloat`` functions to be used when loading from or dumping to XML.\n  Fixed values (e.g. fvar axes and instance coordinates, avar mappings, etc.) are\n  are now stored as un-rounded decimal floats upon decompiling (#1740, #737).\n- [feaLib] Fixed handling of multiple ``LigatureCaret`` statements for the same glyph.\n  Only the first rule per glyph is used, additional ones are ignored (#1733).\n\n4.0.2 (released 2019-09-26)\n---------------------------\n\n- [voltLib] Added support for ``ALL`` and ``NONE`` in ``PROCESS_MARKS`` (#1732).\n- [Silf] Fixed issue in ``Silf`` table compilation and decompilation regarding str vs\n  bytes in python3 (#1728).\n- [merge] Handle duplicate glyph names better: instead of appending font index to\n  all glyph names, use similar code like we use in ``post`` and ``CFF`` tables (#1729).\n\n4.0.1 (released 2019-09-11)\n---------------------------\n\n- [otTables] Support fixing offset overflows in ``MultipleSubst`` lookup subtables\n  (#1706).\n- [subset] Prune empty strikes in ``EBDT`` and ``CBDT`` table data (#1698, #1633).\n- [pens] Fixed issue in ``PointToSegmentPen`` when last point of closed contour has\n  same coordinates as the starting point and was incorrectly dropped (#1720).\n- [Graphite] Fixed ``Sill`` table output to pass OTS (#1705).\n- [name] Added ``removeNames`` method to ``table__n_a_m_e`` class (#1719).\n- [ttLib] Added aliases for renamed entries ``ascender`` and ``descender`` in\n  ``hhea`` table (#1715).\n\n4.0.0 (released 2019-08-22)\n---------------------------\n\n- NOTE: The v4.x version series only supports Python 3.6 or greater. You can keep\n  using fonttools 3.x if you need support for Python 2.\n- [py23] Removed all the python2-only code since it is no longer reachable, thus\n  unused; only the Python3 symbols were kept, but these are no-op. The module is now\n  DEPRECATED and will removed in the future.\n- [ttLib] Fixed UnboundLocalError for empty loca/glyph tables (#1680). Also, allow\n  the glyf table to be incomplete when dumping to XML (#1681).\n- [varLib.models] Fixed KeyError while sorting masters and there are no on-axis for\n  a given axis (38a8eb0e).\n- [cffLib] Make sure glyph names are unique (#1699).\n- [feaLib] Fix feature parser to correctly handle octal numbers (#1700).\n\n3.44.0 (released 2019-08-02)\n----------------------------\n\n- NOTE: This is the last scheduled release to support Python 2.7. The upcoming fonttools\n  v4.x series is going to require Python 3.6 or greater.\n- [varLib] Added new ``varLib.instancer`` module for partially instantiating variable\n  fonts. This extends (and will eventually replace) ``varLib.mutator`` module, as\n  it allows to create not just full static instances from a variable font, but also\n  \"partial\" or \"less variable\" fonts where some of the axes are dropped or\n  instantiated at a particular value.\n  Also available from the command-line as `fonttools varLib.instancer --help`\n  (#1537, #1628).\n- [cffLib] Added support for ``FDSelect`` format 4 (#1677).\n- [subset] Added support for subsetting ``sbix`` (Apple bitmap color font) table.\n- [t1Lib] Fixed issue parsing ``eexec`` section in Type1 fonts when whitespace\n  characters are interspersed among the trailing zeros (#1676).\n- [cffLib.specializer] Fixed bug in ``programToCommands`` with CFF2 charstrings (#1669).\n\n3.43.2 (released 2019-07-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- [featureVars] Fixed region-merging code on python3 (#1659).\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed merging of sparse PrivateDict items (#1653).\n\n3.43.1 (released 2019-06-19)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed regression when passing ``--flavor=woff2`` option with an input font\n  that was already compressed as WOFF 1.0 (#1650).\n\n3.43.0 (released 2019-06-18)\n----------------------------\n\n- [woff2] Added support for compressing/decompressing WOFF2 fonts with non-transformed\n  ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables, as well as with transformed ``hmtx`` table.\n  Removed ``Snippets/woff2_compress.py`` and ``Snippets/woff2_decompress.py`` scripts,\n  and replaced them with a new console entry point ``fonttools ttLib.woff2``\n  that provides two sub-commands ``compress`` and ``decompress``.\n- [varLib.cff] Fixed bug when merging CFF2 ``PrivateDicts``. The ``PrivateDict``\n  data from the first region font was incorrecty used for all subsequent fonts.\n  The bug would only affect variable CFF2 fonts with hinting (#1643, #1644).\n  Also, fixed a merging bug when VF masters have no blends or marking glyphs (#1632,\n  #1642).\n- [loggingTools] Removed unused backport of ``LastResortLogger`` class.\n- [subset] Gracefully handle partial MATH table (#1635).\n- [featureVars] Avoid duplicate references to ``rvrn`` feature record in\n  ``DefaultLangSys`` tables when calling ``addFeatureVariations`` on a font that\n  does not already have a ``GSUB`` table (aa8a5bc6).\n- [varLib] Fixed merging of class-based kerning. Before, the process could introduce\n  rogue kerning values and variations for random classes against class zero (everything\n  not otherwise classed).\n- [varLib] Fixed merging GPOS tables from master fonts with different number of\n  ``SinglePos`` subtables (#1621, #1641).\n- [unicodedata] Updated Blocks, Scripts and ScriptExtensions to Unicode 12.1.\n\n3.42.0 (released 2019-05-28)\n----------------------------\n\n- [OS/2] Fixed sign of ``fsType``: it should be ``uint16``, not ``int16`` (#1619).\n- [subset] Skip out-of-range class values in mark attachment (#1478).\n- [fontBuilder] Add an empty ``DSIG`` table with ``setupDummyDSIG`` method (#1621).\n- [varLib.merger] Fixed bug whereby ``GDEF.GlyphClassDef`` were being dropped\n  when generating instance via ``varLib.mutator`` (#1614).\n- [varLib] Added command-line options ``-v`` and ``-q`` to configure logging (#1613).\n- [subset] Update font extents in head table (#1612).\n- [subset] Make --retain-gids truncate empty glyphs after the last non-empty glyph\n  (#1611).\n- [requirements] Updated ``unicodedata2`` backport for Unicode 12.0.\n\n3.41.2 (released 2019-05-13)\n----------------------------\n\n- [cffLib] Fixed issue when importing a ``CFF2`` variable font from XML, whereby\n  the VarStore state was not propagated to PrivateDict (#1598).\n- [varLib] Don't drop ``post`` glyph names when building CFF2 variable font (#1609).\n\n\n3.41.1 (released 2019-05-13)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Added ``loadSourceFonts`` method to load source fonts using\n  custom opener function (#1606).\n- [head] Round font bounding box coordinates to integers to fix compile error\n  if CFF font has float coordinates (#1604, #1605).\n- [feaLib] Don't write ``None`` in ``ast.ValueRecord.asFea()`` (#1599).\n- [subset] Fixed issue ``AssertionError`` when using ``--desubroutinize`` option\n  (#1590, #1594).\n- [graphite] Fixed bug in ``Silf`` table's ``decompile`` method unmasked by\n  previous typo fix (#1597). Decode languange code as UTF-8 in ``Sill`` table's\n  ``decompile`` method (#1600).\n\n3.41.0 (released 2019-04-29)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib/cffLib] Added support for building ``CFF2`` variable font from sparse\n  masters, or masters with more than one model (multiple ``VarStore.VarData``).\n  In ``cffLib.specializer``, added support for ``CFF2`` CharStrings with\n  ``blend`` operators (#1547, #1591).\n- [subset] Fixed subsetting ``HVAR`` and ``VVAR`` with ``--retain-gids`` option,\n  and when advances mapping is null while sidebearings mappings are non-null\n  (#1587, #1588).\n- Added ``otlLib.maxContextCalc`` module to compute ``OS/2.usMaxContext`` value.\n  Calculate it automatically when compiling features with feaLib. Added option\n  ``--recalc-max-context`` to ``subset`` module (#1582).\n- [otBase/otTables] Fixed ``AttributeError`` on missing OT table fields after\n  importing font from TTX (#1584).\n- [graphite] Fixed typo ``Silf`` table's ``decompile`` method (#1586).\n- [otlLib] Better compress ``GPOS`` SinglePos (LookupType 1) subtables (#1539).\n\n3.40.0 (released 2019-04-08)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Fixed error while subsetting ``VVAR`` with ``--retain-gids``\n  option (#1552).\n- [designspaceLib] Use up-to-date default location in ``findDefault`` method\n  (#1554).\n- [voltLib] Allow passing file-like object to Parser.\n- [arrayTools/glyf] ``calcIntBounds`` (used to compute bounding boxes of glyf\n  table's glyphs) now uses ``otRound`` instead of ``round3`` (#1566).\n- [svgLib] Added support for converting more SVG shapes to path ``d`` strings\n  (ellipse, line, polyline), as well as support for ``transform`` attributes.\n  Only ``matrix`` transformations are currently supported (#1564, #1564).\n- [varLib] Added support for building ``VVAR`` table from ``vmtx`` and ``VORG``\n  tables (#1551).\n- [fontBuilder] Enable making CFF2 fonts with ``post`` table format 2 (#1557).\n- Fixed ``DeprecationWarning`` on invalid escape sequences (#1562).\n\n3.39.0 (released 2019-03-19)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttLib/glyf] Raise more specific error when encountering recursive\n  component references (#1545, #1546).\n- [Doc/designspaceLib] Defined new ``public.skipExportGlyphs`` lib key (#1534,\n  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#84).\n- [varLib] Use ``vmtx`` to compute vertical phantom points; or ``hhea.ascent``\n  and ``head.unitsPerEM`` if ``vmtx`` is missing (#1528).\n- [gvar/cvar] Sort XML element's min/value/max attributes in TupleVariation\n  toXML to improve readability of TTX dump (#1527).\n- [varLib.plot] Added support for 2D plots with only 1 variation axis (#1522).\n- [designspaceLib] Use axes maps when normalizing locations in\n  DesignSpaceDocument (#1226, #1521), and when finding default source (#1535).\n- [mutator] Set ``OVERLAP_SIMPLE`` and ``OVERLAP_COMPOUND`` glyf flags by\n  default in ``instantiateVariableFont``.

Fix that.\n\n3.37.2 (released 2019-02-05)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Temporarily revert the fix to ``load_masters()``, which caused a\n  crash in ``interpolate_layout()`` when ``deepcopy``-ing OTFs.\n\n3.37.1 (released 2019-02-05)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] ``load_masters()`` now actually assigns the fonts it loads to the\n  source.font attributes.\n- [varLib] Fixed an MVAR table generation crash when sparse masters were\n  involved.\n- [voltLib] ``parse_coverage_()`` returns a tuple instead of an ast.Enum.\n- [feaLib] A MarkClassDefinition inside a block is no longer doubly indented\n  compared to the rest of the block.\n\n3.37.0 (released 2019-01-28)\n----------------------------\n\n- [svgLib] Added support for converting elliptical arcs to cubic bezier curves\n  (#1464).\n- [py23] Added backport for ``math.isfinite``.\n- [varLib] Apply HIDDEN flag to fvar axis if designspace axis has attribute\n  ``hidden=1``.\n- Fixed \"DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence\" in Python 3.7.\n- [voltLib] Fixed parsing glyph groups. Distinguish different PROCESS_MARKS.\n  Accept COMPONENT glyph type.\n- [feaLib] Distinguish missing value and explicit ``<NULL>`` for PairPos2\n  format A (#1459). Round-trip ``useExtension`` keyword. Implemented\n  ``ValueRecord.asFea`` method.\n- [subset] Insert empty widths into hdmx when retaining gids (#1458).\n\n3.36.0 (released 2019-01-17)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttx] Added ``--no-recalc-timestamp`` option to keep the original font's\n  ``head.modified`` timestamp (#1455, #46).\n- [ttx/psCharStrings] Fixed issues while dumping and round-tripping CFF2 table\n  with ttx (#1451, #1452, #1456).\n- [voltLib] Fixed check for duplicate anchors (#1450). Don't try to read past\n  the ``END`` operator in .vtp file (#1453).\n- [varLib] Use sentinel value -0x8000 (-32768) to ignore post.underlineThickness\n  and post.underlinePosition when generating MVAR deltas (#1449,\n  googlei18n/ufo2ft#308).\n- [subset] Added ``--retain-gids`` option to subset font without modifying the\n  current glyph indices (#1443, #1447).\n- [ufoLib] Replace deprecated calls to ``getbytes`` and ``setbytes`` with new\n  equivalent ``readbytes`` and ``writebytes`` calls. ``fs`` >= 2.2 no required.\n- [varLib] Allow loading masters from TTX files as well (#1441).\n\n3.35.2 (released 2019-01-14)\n----------------------------\n\n- [hmtx/vmtx]: Allow to compile/decompile ``hmtx`` and ``vmtx`` tables even\n  without the corresponding (required) metrics header tables, ``hhea`` and\n  ``vhea`` (#1439).\n- [varLib] Added support for localized axes' ``labelname`` and named instances'\n  ``stylename`` (#1438).\n\n3.35.1 (released 2019-01-09)\n----------------------------\n\n- [_m_a_x_p] Include ``maxComponentElements`` in ``maxp`` table's recalculation.\n\n3.35.0 (released 2019-01-07)\n----------------------------\n\n- [psCharStrings] In ``encodeFloat`` function, use float's \"general format\" with\n  8 digits of precision (i.e. ``%8g``) instead of ``str()``. This works around\n  a macOS rendering issue when real numbers in CFF table are too long, and\n  also makes sure that floats are encoded with the same precision in python 2.7\n  and 3.x (#1430, googlei18n/ufo2ft#306).\n- [_n_a_m_e/fontBuilder] Make ``_n_a_m_e_table.addMultilingualName`` also add\n  Macintosh (platformID=1) names by default. Added options to ``FontBuilder``\n  ``setupNameTable`` method to optionally disable Macintosh or Windows names.\n  (#1359, #1431).\n- [varLib] Make ``build`` optionally accept a ``DesignSpaceDocument`` object,\n  instead of a designspace file path.

The\n  ``fontTools.varLib.designspace`` module is now deprecated and will be removed\n  in future versions. The presence of an explicit ``axes`` element is now\n  required in order to build a variable font (#1224, #1313).\n- [varLib] Implemented building GSUB FeatureVariations table from the ``rules``\n  element of DesignSpace document (#1240, #713, #1314).\n- [subset] Added ``--no-layout-closure`` option to not expand the subset with\n  the glyphs produced by OpenType layout features. Instead, OpenType features\n  will be subset to only rules that are relevant to the otherwise-specified\n  glyph set (#43, #1121).\n\n3.29.1 (released 2018-09-10)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Fixed issue whereby lookups from DFLT/dflt were not included in the\n  DFLT/non-dflt language systems (#1307).\n- [graphite] Fixed issue on big-endian architectures (e.g. ppc64) (#1311).\n- [subset] Added ``--layout-scripts`` option to add/exclude set of OpenType\n  layout scripts that will be preserved. By default all scripts are retained\n  (``'*'``) (#1303).\n\n3.29.0 (released 2018-07-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] In the OTL table builder, when the ``name`` table is excluded\n  from the list of tables to be build, skip compiling ``featureNames`` blocks,\n  as the records referenced in ``FeatureParams`` table don't exist (68951b7).\n- [otBase] Try ``ExtensionLookup`` if other offset-overflow methods fail\n  (05f95f0).\n- [feaLib] Added support for explicit ``subtable;`` break statements in\n  PairPos lookups; previously these were ignored (#1279, #1300, #1302).\n- [cffLib.specializer] Make sure the stack depth does not exceed maxstack - 1,\n  so that a subroutinizer can insert subroutine calls (#1301,\n  https://github.com/googlei18n/ufo2ft/issues/266).\n- [otTables] Added support for fixing offset overflow errors occurring inside\n  ``MarkBasePos`` subtables (#1297).\n- [subset] Write the default output file extension based on ``--flavor`` option,\n  or the value of ``TTFont.sfntVersion`` (d7ac0ad).\n- [unicodedata] Updated Blocks, Scripts and ScriptExtensions for Unicode 11\n  (452c85e).\n- [xmlWriter] Added context manager to XMLWriter class to autoclose file\n  descriptor on exit (#1290).\n- [psCharStrings] Optimize the charstring's bytecode by encoding as integers\n  all float values that have no decimal portion (8d7774a).\n- [ttFont] Fixed missing import of ``TTLibError`` exception (#1285).\n- [feaLib] Allow any languages other than ``dflt`` under ``DFLT`` script\n  (#1278, #1292).\n\n3.28.0 (released 2018-06-19)\n----------------------------\n\n- [featureVars] Added experimental module to build ``FeatureVariations``\n  tables. Still needs to be hooked up to ``varLib.build`` (#1240).\n- [fixedTools] Added ``otRound`` to round floats to nearest integer towards\n  positive Infinity. This is now used where we deal with visual data like X/Y\n  coordinates, advance widths/heights, variation deltas, and similar (#1274,\n  #1248).\n- [subset] Improved GSUB closure memoize algorithm.\n- [varLib.models] Fixed regression in model resolution (180124, #1269).\n- [feaLib.ast] Fixed error when converting ``SubtableStatement`` to string\n  (#1275).\n- [varLib.mutator] Set ``OS/2.usWeightClass`` and ``usWidthClass``, and\n  ``post.italicAngle`` based on the 'wght', 'wdth' and 'slnt' axis values\n  (#1276, #1264).\n- [py23/loggingTools] Don't automatically set ``logging.lastResort`` handler\n  on py27. Moved ``LastResortLogger`` to the ``loggingTools`` module (#1277).\n\n3.27.1 (released 2018-06-11)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttGlyphPen] Issue a warning and skip building non-existing components\n  (https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/411).\n- [tests] Fixed issue running ttx_test.py from a tagged commit.\n\n3.27.0 (released 2018-06-11)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Added new ``conditionSet`` element to ``rule`` element in\n  designspace document. Bumped ``format`` attribute to ``4.0`` (previously,\n  it was formatted as an integer). Removed ``checkDefault``, ``checkAxes``\n  methods, and any kind of guessing about the axes when the ``<axes>`` element\n  is missing. The default master is expected at the intersection of all default\n  values for each axis (#1254, #1255, #1267).\n- [cffLib] Fixed issues when compiling CFF2 or converting from CFF when the\n  font has an FDArray (#1211, #1271).\n- [varLib] Avoid attempting to build ``cvar`` table when ``glyf`` table is not\n  present, as is the case for CFF2 fonts.\n- [subset] Handle None coverages in MarkGlyphSets; revert commit 02616ab that\n  sets empty Coverage tables in MarkGlyphSets to None, to make OTS happy.\n- [ttFont] Allow to build glyph order from ``maxp.numGlyphs`` when ``post`` or\n  ``cmap`` are missing.\n- [ttFont] Added ``__len__`` method to ``_TTGlyphSet``.\n- [glyf] Ensure ``GlyphCoordinates`` never overflow signed shorts (#1230).\n- [py23] Added alias for ``itertools.izip`` shadowing the built-in ``zip``.\n- [loggingTools] Memoize ``log`` property of ``LogMixin`` class (fbab12).\n- [ttx] Impoved test coverage (#1261).\n- [Snippets] Addded script to append a suffix to all family names in a font.\n- [varLib.plot] Make it work with matplotlib >= 2.1 (b38e2b).\n\n3.26.0 (released 2018-05-03)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspace] Added a new optional ``layer`` attribute to the source element,\n  and a corresponding ``layerName`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``\n  object (#1253).\n  Added ``conditionset`` element to the ``rule`` element to the spec, but not\n  implemented in designspace reader/writer yet (#1254).\n- [varLib.models] Refine modeling one last time (0ecf5c5).\n- [otBase] Fixed sharing of tables referred to by different offset sizes\n  (795f2f9).\n- [subset] Don't drop a GDEF that only has VarStore (fc819d6). Set to None\n  empty Coverage tables in MarkGlyphSets (02616ab).\n- [varLib]: Added ``--master-finder`` command-line option (#1249).\n- [varLib.mutator] Prune fvar nameIDs from instance's name table (#1245).\n- [otTables] Allow decompiling bad ClassDef tables with invalid format, with\n  warning (#1236).\n- [varLib] Make STAT v1.2 and reuse nameIDs from fvar table (#1242).\n- [varLib.plot] Show master locations. Set axis limits to -1, +1.\n- [subset] Handle HVAR direct mapping. Passthrough 'cvar'.\n  Added ``--font-number`` command-line option for collections.\n- [t1Lib] Allow a text encoding to be specified when parsing a Type 1 font\n  (#1234). Added ``kind`` argument to T1Font constructor (c5c161c).\n- [ttLib] Added context manager API to ``TTFont`` class, so it can be used in\n  ``with`` statements to auto-close the file when exiting the context (#1232).\n\n3.25.0 (released 2018-04-03)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Improved support-resolution algorithm. Previously, the on-axis\n  masters would always cut the space. They don't anymore. That's more\n  consistent, and fixes the main issue Erik showed at TYPO Labs 2017.\n  Any varfont built that had an unusual master configuration will change\n  when rebuilt (42bef17, a523a697,\n  https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/264).\n- [varLib.models] Added a ``main()`` entry point, that takes positions and\n  prints model results.\n- [varLib.plot] Added new module to plot a designspace's\n  VariationModel. Requires ``matplotlib``.\n- [varLib.mutator] Added -o option to specify output file path (2ef60fa).\n- [otTables] Fixed IndexError while pruning of HVAR pre-write (6b6c34a).\n- [varLib.models] Convert delta array to floats if values overflows signed\n  short integer (0055f94).\n\n3.24.2 (released 2018-03-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [otBase] Don't fail during ``ValueRecord`` copy if src has more items.\n  We drop hinting in the subsetter by simply changing ValueFormat, without\n  cleaning up the actual ValueRecords. This was causing assertion error if\n  a variable font was subsetted without hinting and then passed directly to\n  the mutator for instantiation without first it saving to disk.\n\n3.24.1 (released 2018-03-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Don't remap the same ``DeviceTable`` twice in VarStore optimizer\n  (#1206).\n- [varLib] Add ``--disable-iup`` option to ``fonttools varLib`` script,\n  and a ``optimize=True`` keyword argument to ``varLib.build`` function,\n  to optionally disable IUP optimization while building varfonts.\n- [ttCollection] Fixed issue while decompiling ttc with python3 (#1207).\n\n3.24.0 (released 2018-03-01)\n----------------------------\n\n- [ttGlyphPen] Decompose composite glyphs if any components' transform is too\n  large to fit a ``F2Dot14`` value, or clamp transform values that are\n  (almost) equal to +2.0 to make them fit and avoid decomposing (#1200,\n  #1204, #1205).\n- [ttx] Added new ``-g`` option to dump glyphs from the ``glyf`` table\n  splitted as individual ttx files (#153, #1035, #1132, #1202).\n- Copied ``ufoLib.filenames`` module to ``fontTools.misc.filenames``, used\n  for the ttx split-glyphs option (#1202).\n- [feaLib] Added support for ``cvParameters`` blocks in Character Variant\n  feautures ``cv01-cv99`` (#860, #1169).\n- [Snippets] Added ``checksum.py`` script to generate/check SHA1 hash of\n  ttx files (#1197).\n- [varLib.mutator] Fixed issue while instantiating some variable fonts\n  whereby the horizontal advance width computed from ``gvar`` phantom points\n  could turn up to be negative (#1198).\n- [varLib/subset] Fixed issue with subsetting GPOS variation data not\n  picking up ``ValueRecord`` ``Device`` objects (54fd71f).\n- [feaLib/voltLib] In all AST elements, the ``location`` is no longer a\n  required positional argument, but an optional kewyord argument (defaults\n  to ``None``). This will make it easier to construct feature AST from\n  code (#1201).\n\n\n3.23.0 (released 2018-02-26)\n----------------------------\n\n- [designspaceLib] Added an optional ``lib`` element to the designspace as a\n  whole, as well as to the instance elements, to store arbitrary data in a\n  property list dictionary, similar to the UFO's ``lib``. Added an optional\n  ``font`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``, to allow operating on\n  in-memory font objects (#1175).\n- [cffLib] Fixed issue with lazy-loading of attributes when attempting to\n  set the CFF TopDict.Encoding (#1177, #1187).\n- [ttx] Fixed regression introduced in 3.22.0 that affected the split tables\n  ``-s`` option (#1188).\n- [feaLib] Added ``IncludedFeaNotFound`` custom exception subclass, raised\n  when an included feature file cannot be found (#1186).\n- [otTables] Changed ``VarIdxMap`` to use glyph names internally instead of\n  glyph indexes. The old ttx dumps of HVAR/VVAR tables that contain indexes\n  can still be imported (21cbab8, 38a0ffb).\n- [varLib] Implemented VarStore optimizer (#1184).\n- [subset] Implemented pruning of GDEF VarStore, HVAR and MVAR (#1179).\n- [sfnt] Restore backward compatiblity with ``numFonts`` attribute of\n  ``SFNTReader`` object (#1181).\n- [merge] Initial support for merging ``LangSysRecords`` (#1180).\n- [ttCollection] don't seek(0) when writing to possibly unseekable strems.\n- [subset] Keep all ``--name-IDs`` from 0 to 6 by default (#1170, #605, #114).\n- [cffLib] Added ``width`` module to calculate optimal CFF default and\n  nominal glyph widths.\n- [varLib] Don’t fail if STAT already in the master fonts (#1166).\n\n3.22.0 (released 2018-02-04)\n----------------------------\n\n- [subset] Support subsetting ``endchar`` acting as ``seac``-like components\n  in ``CFF`` (fixes #1162).\n- [feaLib] Allow to build from pre-parsed ``ast.FeatureFile`` object.\n  Added ``tables`` argument to only build some tables instead of all (#1159,\n  #1163).\n- [textTools] Replaced ``safeEval`` with ``ast.literal_eval`` (#1139).\n- [feaLib] Added option to the parser to not resolve ``include`` statements\n  (#1154).\n- [ttLib] Added new ``ttCollection`` module to read/write TrueType and\n  OpenType Collections. Exports a ``TTCollection`` class with a ``fonts``\n  attribute containing a list of ``TTFont`` instances, the methods ``save``\n  and ``saveXML``, plus some list-like methods. The ``importXML`` method is\n  not implemented yet (#17).\n- [unicodeadata] Added ``ot_tag_to_script`` function that converts from\n  OpenType script tag to Unicode script code.\n- Added new ``designspaceLib`` subpackage, originally from Erik Van Blokland's\n  ``designSpaceDocument``: https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument\n  NOTE: this is not yet used internally by varLib, and the API may be subject\n  to changes (#911, #1110, LettError/designSpaceDocument#28).\n- Added new FontTools icon images (8ee7c32).\n- [unicodedata] Added ``script_horizontal_direction`` function that returns\n  either \"LTR\" or \"RTL\" given a unicode script code.\n- [otConverters] Don't write descriptive name string as XML comment if the\n  NameID value is 0 (== NULL) (#1151, #1152).\n- [unicodedata] Add ``ot_tags_from_script`` function to get the list of\n  OpenType script tags associated with unicode script code (#1150).\n- [feaLib] Don't error when \"enumerated\" kern pairs conflict with preceding\n  single pairs; emit warning and chose the first value (#1147, #1148).\n- [loggingTools] In ``CapturingLogHandler.assertRegex`` method, match the\n  fully formatted log message.\n- [sbix] Fixed TypeError when concatenating str and bytes (#1154).\n- [bezierTools] Implemented cusp support and removed ``approximate_fallback``\n  arg in ``calcQuadraticArcLength``. Added ``calcCubicArcLength`` (#1142).\n\n3.21.2 (released 2018-01-08)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Fixed merging PairPos Format1/2 with missing subtables (#1125).\n\n3.21.1 (released 2018-01-03)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Allow mixed single/multiple substitutions (#612)\n- Added missing ``*.afm`` test assets to MAINFEST.in (#1137).\n- Fixed dumping ``SVG`` tables containing color palettes (#1124).\n\n3.21.0 (released 2017-12-18)\n----------------------------\n\n- [cmap] when compiling format6 subtable, don't assume gid0 is always called\n  '.notdef' (1e42224).\n- [ot] Allow decompiling fonts with bad Coverage format number (1aafae8).\n- Change FontTools licence to MIT (#1127).\n- [post] Prune extra names already in standard Mac set (df1e8c7).\n- [subset] Delete empty SubrsIndex after subsetting (#994, #1118).\n- [varLib] Don't share points in cvar by default, as it currently fails on\n  some browsers (#1113).\n- [afmLib] Make poor old afmLib work on python3.\n\n3.20.1 (released 2017-11-22)\n----------------------------\n\n- [unicodedata] Fixed issue with ``script`` and ``script_extension`` functions\n  returning inconsistent short vs long names. They both return the short four-\n  letter script codes now. Added ``script_name`` and ``script_code`` functions\n  to look up the long human-readable script name from the script code, and\n  viceversa (#1109, #1111).\n\n3.20.0 (released 2017-11-21)\n----------------------------\n\n- [unicodedata] Addded new module ``fontTools.unicodedata`` which exports the\n  same interface as the built-in ``unicodedata`` module, with the addition of\n  a few functions that are missing from the latter, such as ``script``,\n  ``script_extension`` and ``block``. Added a ``MetaTools/buildUCD.py`` script\n  to download and parse data files from the Unicode Character Database and\n  generate python modules containing lists of ranges and property values.\n- [feaLib] Added ``__str__`` method to all ``ast`` elements (delegates to the\n  ``asFea`` method).\n- [feaLib] ``Parser`` constructor now accepts a ``glyphNames`` iterable\n  instead of ``glyphMap`` dict. The latter still works but with a pending\n  deprecation warning (#1104).\n- [bezierTools] Added arc length calculation functions originally from\n  ``pens.perimeterPen`` module (#1101).\n- [varLib] Started generating STAT table (8af4309). Right now it just reflects\n  the axes, and even that with certain limitations:\n  * AxisOrdering is set to the order axes are defined,\n  * Name-table entries are not shared with fvar.\n- [py23] Added backports for ``redirect_stdout`` and ``redirect_stderr``\n  context managers (#1097).\n- [Graphite] Fixed some round-trip bugs (#1093).\n\n3.19.0 (released 2017-11-06)\n----------------------------\n\n- [varLib] Try set of used points instead of all points when testing whether to\n  share points between tuples (#1090).\n- [CFF2] Fixed issue with reading/writing PrivateDict BlueValues to TTX file.\n  Read the commit message 8b02b5a and issue #1030 for more details.\n  NOTE: this change invalidates all the TTX files containing CFF2 tables\n  that where dumped with previous verisons of fonttools.\n  CFF2 Subr items can have values on the stack after the last operator, thus\n  a ``CFF2Subr`` class was added to accommodate this (#1091).\n- [_k_e_r_n] Fixed compilation of AAT kern version=1.0 tables (#1089, #1094)\n- [ttLib] Added getBestCmap() convenience method to TTFont class and cmap table\n  class that returns a preferred Unicode cmap subtable given a list of options\n  (#1092).\n- [morx] Emit more meaningful subtable flags. Implement InsertionMorphAction\n\n3.18.0 (released 2017-10-30)\n----------------------------\n\n- [feaLib] Fixed writing back nested glyph classes (#1086).\n- [TupleVariation] Reactivated shared points logic, bugfixes (#1009).\n- [AAT] Implemented ``morx`` ligature subtables (#1082).\n- [reverseContourPen] Keep duplicate lineTo following a moveTo (#1080,\n  https://github.com/googlei18n/cu2qu/issues/51).\n- [varLib.mutator] Suport instantiation of GPOS, GDEF and MVAR (#1079).\n- [sstruct] Fixed issue with ``unicode_literals`` and ``struct`` module in\n  old versions of python 2.7 (#993).\n\n3.17.0 (released 2017-10-16)\n----------------------------\n\n- [svgPathPen] Added an ``SVGPathPen`` that translates segment pen commands\n  into SVG path descriptions.

A warning is emitted when\n   code or XML needs fix.\n-  several bug fixes to the cffLib module, contributed by Adobe's\n   @readroberts\n-  The XML output for CFF table now has a 'major' and 'minor' elements\n   for specifying whether it's version 1.0 or 2.0 (support for CFF2 is\n   coming soon)\n-  [setup.py] remove undocumented/deprecated ``extra_path`` Distutils\n   argument. This means that we no longer create a \"FontTools\" subfolder\n   in site-packages containing the actual fontTools package, as well as\n   the standalone xmlWriter and sstruct modules.

Fixes dumping of these\n   GPL fonts: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/chinese/wangttf\n-  Fixed ttx -l: it turned out this part of the code didn't work with\n   Python 2.2.1 and earlier. My bad to do most of my testing with a\n   different version than I shipped TTX with :-(\n-  Fixed bug in ClassDef format 1 subtable (Andreas Seidel bumped into\n   this one).\n\n2.0b1 (released 2002-09-10)\n---------------------------\n\n-  Fixed embarrassing bug: the master checksum in the head table is now\n   calculated correctly even on little-endian platforms (such as Intel).\n-  Made the cmap format 4 compiler smarter: the binary data it creates\n   is now more or less as compact as possible. TTX now makes more\n   compact data than in any shipping font I've tested it with.\n-  Dump glyph names as a separate \"GlyphOrder\" pseudo table as opposed\n   to as part of the glyf table (obviously needed for CFF-OTF's).\n-  Added proper support for the CFF table.\n-  Don't barf on empty tables (questionable, but \"there are font out\n   there...\")\n-  When writing TT glyf data, align glyphs on 4-byte boundaries. This\n   seems to be the current recommendation by MS. Also: don't barf on\n   fonts which are already 4-byte aligned.\n-  Windows installer contributed bu Adam Twardoch! Yay!\n-  Changed the command line interface again, now by creating one new\n   tool replacing the old ones: ttx It dumps and compiles, depending on\n   input file types. The options have changed somewhat.\n-  The -d option is back (output dir)\n-  ttcompile's -i options is now called -m (as in \"merge\"), to avoid\n   clash with dump's -i.\n-  The -s option (\"split tables\") no longer creates a directory, but\n   instead outputs a small .ttx file containing references to the\n   individual table files. This is not a true link, it's a simple file\n   name, and the referenced file should be in the same directory so\n   ttcompile can find them.\n-  compile no longer accepts a directory as input argument. Instead it\n   can parse the new \"mini-ttx\" format as output by \"ttx -s\".\n-  all arguments are input files\n-  Renamed the command line programs and moved them to the Tools\n   subdirectory. They are now installed by the setup.py install script.\n-  Added OpenType support. BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and JSTF are (almost)\n   fully supported. The XML output is not yet final, as I'm still\n   considering to output certain subtables in a more human-friendly\n   manner.\n-  Fixed 'kern' table to correctly accept subtables it doesn't know\n   about, as well as interpreting Apple's definition of the 'kern' table\n   headers correctly.\n-  Fixed bug where glyphnames were not calculated from 'cmap' if it was\n   (one of the) first tables to be decompiled. More specifically: it\n   cmap was the first to ask for a glyphID -> glyphName mapping.\n-  Switched XML parsers: use expat instead of xmlproc. Should be faster.\n-  Removed my UnicodeString object: I now require Python 2.0 or up,\n   which has unicode support built in.\n-  Removed assert in glyf table: redundant data at the end of the table\n   is now ignored instead of raising an error. Should become a warning.\n-  Fixed bug in hmtx/vmtx code that only occured if all advances were\n   equal.\n-  Fixed subtle bug in TT instruction disassembler.\n-  Couple of fixes to the 'post' table.\n-  Updated OS/2 table to latest spec.\n\n1.0b1 (released 2001-08-10)\n---------------------------\n\n-  Reorganized the command line interface for ttDump.py and\n   ttCompile.py, they now behave more like \"normal\" command line tool,\n   in that they accept multiple input files for batch processing.\n-  ttDump.py and ttCompile.py don't silently override files anymore, but\n   ask before doing so. Can be overridden by -f.\n-  Added -d option to both ttDump.py and ttCompile.py.\n-  Installation is now done with distutils. (Needs work for environments\n   without compilers.)\n-  Updated installation instructions.\n-  Added some workarounds so as to handle certain buggy fonts more\n   gracefully.\n-  Updated Unicode table to Unicode 3.0 (Thanks Antoine!)\n-  Included a Python script by Adam Twardoch that adds some useful stuff\n   to the Windows registry.\n-  Moved the project to SourceForge.\n\n1.0a6 (released 2000-03-15)\n---------------------------\n\n-  Big reorganization: made ttLib a subpackage of the new fontTools\n   package, changed several module names. Called the entire suite\n   \"FontTools\"\n-  Added several submodules to fontTools, some new, some older.\n-  Added experimental CFF/GPOS/GSUB support to ttLib, read-only (but XML\n   dumping of GPOS/GSUB is for now disabled)\n-  Fixed hdmx endian bug\n-  Added -b option to ttCompile.py, it disables recalculation of\n   bounding boxes, as requested by Werner Lemberg.\n-  Renamed tt2xml.pt to ttDump.py and xml2tt.py to ttCompile.py\n-  Use \".ttx\" as file extension instead of \".xml\".\n-  TTX is now the name of the XML-based *format* for TT fonts, and not\n   just an application.\n\n1.0a5\n-----\n\nNever released\n\n-  More tables supported: hdmx, vhea, vmtx\n\n1.0a3 & 1.0a4\n-------------\n\nNever released\n\n-  fixed most portability issues\n-  retracted the \"Euro_or_currency\" change from 1.0a2: it was\n   nonsense!\n\n1.0a2 (released 1999-05-02)\n---------------------------\n\n-  binary release for MacOS\n-  genenates full FOND resources: including width table, PS font name\n   info and kern table if applicable.\n-  added cmap format 4 support. Extra: dumps Unicode char names as XML\n   comments!\n-  added cmap format 6 support\n-  now accepts true type files starting with \"true\" (instead of just\n   0x00010000 and \"OTTO\")\n-  'glyf' table support is now complete: I added support for composite\n   scale, xy-scale and two-by-two for the 'glyf' table. For now,\n   component offset scale behaviour defaults to Apple-style. This only\n   affects the (re)calculation of the glyph bounding box.\n-  changed \"Euro\" to \"Euro_or_currency\" in the Standard Apple Glyph\n   order list, since we cannot tell from the 'post' table which is\n   meant. I should probably doublecheck with a Unicode encoding if\n   available. (This does not affect the output!)\n\nFixed bugs: - 'hhea' table is now recalculated correctly - fixed wrong\nassumption about sfnt resource names\n\n1.0a1 (released 1999-04-27)\n---------------------------\n\n-  initial binary release for MacOS\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/52/c0/b117fe560be1c7bf889e341d1437c207dace4380b10c14f9c7a047df945b/fonttools-4.49.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2010 Pablo Impallari (www.impallari.com|impallari@gmail.com), .

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n   d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   g.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Somewhat similar to\nPython this happens to be 'good enough', but at the same time is deeply flawed and broken beyond repair.\n\nBy now, GitPython is widely used and I am sure there is a good reason for that, it's something to be proud of and happy about.\nThe community is maintaining the software and is keeping it relevant for which I am absolutely grateful. For the time to come I am happy to continue maintaining GitPython, remaining hopeful that one day it won't be needed anymore.\n\nMore than 15 years after my first meeting with 'git' I am still in excited about it, and am happy to finally have the tools and\nprobably the skills to scratch that itch of mine: implement `git` in a way that makes tool creation a piece of cake for most.\n\nIf you like the idea and want to learn more, please head over to [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide), an\nimplementation of 'git' in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).\n\n*(Please note that `gitoxide` is not currently available for use in Python, and that Rust is required.)*\n\n## GitPython\n\nGitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain,\nor low-level like git-plumbing.\n\nIt provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data often backed by calling the `git`\ncommand-line program.\n\n### DEVELOPMENT STATUS\n\nThis project is in **maintenance mode**, which means that\n\n- …there will be no feature development, unless these are contributed\n- …there will be no bug fixes, unless they are relevant to the safety of users, or contributed\n- …issues will be responded to with waiting times of up to a month\n\nThe project is open to contributions of all kinds, as well as new maintainers.\n\n### REQUIREMENTS\n\nGitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available in your\n`PATH` for most operations. If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find it\nby setting the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.\n\n- Git (1.7.x or newer)\n- Python >= 3.7\n\nThe list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt` and `./test-requirements.txt`.\nThe installer takes care of installing them for you.\n\n### INSTALL\n\nGitPython and its required package dependencies can be installed in any of the following ways, all of which should typically be done in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n\n#### From PyPI\n\nTo obtain and install a copy [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/), run:\n\n```sh\npip install GitPython\n```\n\n(A distribution package can also be downloaded for manual installation at [the PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/).)\n\n#### From downloaded source code\n\nIf you have downloaded the source code, run this from inside the unpacked `GitPython` directory:\n\n```sh\npip install .\n```\n\n#### By cloning the source code repository\n\nTo clone the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) from source to work on the code, you can do it like so:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython\ncd GitPython\n./init-tests-after-clone.sh\n```\n\nOn Windows, `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` can be run in a Git Bash shell.\n\nIf you are cloning [your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks), then replace the above `git clone` command with one that gives the URL of your fork. Or use this [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) command (assuming you have `gh` and your fork is called `GitPython`):\n\n```sh\ngh repo clone GitPython\n```\n\nHaving cloned the repo, create and activate your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n\nThen make an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs):\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n```\n\nIn the less common case that you do not want to install test dependencies, `pip install -e .` can be used instead.\n\n#### With editable *dependencies* (not preferred, and rarely needed)\n\nIn rare cases, you may want to work on GitPython and one or both of its [gitdb](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitdb) and [smmap](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap) dependencies at the same time, with changes in your local working copy of gitdb or smmap immediatley reflected in the behavior of your local working copy of GitPython. This can be done by making editable installations of those dependencies in the same virtual environment where you install GitPython.\n\nIf you want to do that *and* you want the versions in GitPython's git submodules to be used, then pass `-e git/ext/gitdb` and/or `-e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap` to `pip install`. This can be done in any order, and in separate `pip install` commands or the same one, so long as `-e` appears before *each* path. For example, you can install GitPython, gitdb, and smmap editably in the currently active virtual environment this way:\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\" -e git/ext/gitdb -e git/ext/gitdb/gitdb/ext/smmap\n```\n\nThe submodules must have been cloned for that to work, but that will already be the case if you have run `./init-tests-after-clone.sh`. You can use `pip list` to check which packages are installed editably and which are installed normally.\n\nTo reiterate, this approach should only rarely be used. For most development it is preferable to allow the gitdb and smmap dependencices to be retrieved automatically from PyPI in their latest stable packaged versions.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Leakage of System Resources\n\nGitPython is not suited for long-running processes (like daemons) as it tends to\nleak system resources. It was written in a time where destructors (as implemented\nin the `__del__` method) still ran deterministically.\n\nIn case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to search the\ncodebase for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself when you see fit.\n\nAnother way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython into a\nseparate process which can be dropped periodically.\n\n#### Windows support\n\nSee [Issue #525](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/525).\n\n### RUNNING TESTS\n\n_Important_: Right after cloning this repository, please be sure to have executed\nthe `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` script in the repository root. Otherwise\nyou will encounter test failures.\n\n#### Install test dependencies\n\nEnsure testing libraries are installed. This is taken care of already if you installed with:\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n```\n\nIf you had installed with a command like `pip install -e .` instead, you can still run\nthe above command to add the testing dependencies.\n\n#### Test commands\n\nTo test, run:\n\n```sh\npytest\n```\n\nTo lint, and apply some linting fixes as well as automatic code formatting, run:\n\n```sh\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\nThis includes the linting and autoformatting done by Ruff, as well as some other checks.\n\nTo typecheck, run:\n\n```sh\nmypy\n```\n\n#### CI (and tox)\n\nStyle and formatting checks, and running tests on all the different supported Python versions, will be performed:\n\n- Upon submitting a pull request.\n- On each push, *if* you have a fork with GitHub Actions enabled.\n- Locally, if you run [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/) (this skips any Python versions you don't have installed).\n\n#### Configuration files\n\nSpecific tools are all configured in the `./pyproject.toml` file:\n\n- `pytest` (test runner)\n- `coverage.py` (code coverage)\n- `ruff` (linter and formatter)\n- `mypy` (type checker)\n\nOrchestration tools:\n\n- Configuration for `pre-commit` is in the `./.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.\n- Configuration for `tox` is in `./tox.ini`.\n- Configuration for GitHub Actions (CI) is in files inside `./.github/workflows/`.\n\n### Contributions\n\nPlease have a look at the [contributions file][contributing].\n\n### INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n- [User Documentation](http://gitpython.readthedocs.org)\n- [Questions and Answers](http://stackexchange.com/filters/167317/gitpython)\n- Please post on Stack Overflow and use the `gitpython` tag\n- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues)\n  - Post reproducible bugs and feature requests as a new issue.\n    Please be sure to provide the following information if posting bugs:\n    - GitPython version (e.g. `import git; git.__version__`)\n    - Python version (e.g. `python --version`)\n    - The encountered stack-trace, if applicable\n    - Enough information to allow reproducing the issue\n\n### How to make a new release\n\n1. Update/verify the **version** in the `VERSION` file.\n2. Update/verify that the `doc/source/changes.rst` changelog file was updated. It should include a link to the forthcoming release page: `https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases/tag/<version>`\n3. Commit everything.\n4. Run `git tag -s <version>` to tag the version in Git.\n5. _Optionally_ create and activate a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment). (Then the next step can install `build` and `twine`.)\n6. Run `make release`.\n7. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases) and publish a new one with the recently pushed tag. Generate the changelog.\n\n### Projects using GitPython\n\n- [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller)\n- [Kivy Designer](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-designer)\n- [Prowl](https://github.com/nettitude/Prowl)\n- [Python Taint](https://github.com/python-security/pyt)\n- [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster)\n- [git-ftp](https://github.com/ezyang/git-ftp)\n- [Git-Pandas](https://github.com/wdm0006/git-pandas)\n- [PyGitUp](https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp)\n- [PyJFuzz](https://github.com/mseclab/PyJFuzz)\n- [Loki](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki)\n- [Omniwallet](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omniwallet)\n- [GitViper](https://github.com/BeayemX/GitViper)\n- [Git Gud](https://github.com/bthayer2365/git-gud)\n\n### LICENSE\n\n[3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/), also known as the New BSD License.

Please check the\n`ROADMAP <https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/blob/master/ROADMAP.md>`__\nto see how you can help ������\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n`Graphene <http://graphene-python.org>`__ is an opinionated Python\nlibrary for building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.\n\n-  **Easy to use:** Graphene helps you use GraphQL in Python without\n   effort.\n-  **Relay:** Graphene has builtin support for Relay.\n-  **Data agnostic:** Graphene supports any kind of data source: SQL\n   (Django, SQLAlchemy), NoSQL, custom Python objects, etc. We believe\n   that by providing a complete API you could plug Graphene anywhere\n   your data lives and make your data available through GraphQL.\n\nIntegrations\n------------\n\nGraphene has multiple integrations with different frameworks:\n\n+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+\n| integration       | Package                                         |\n+===================+=================================================+\n| Django            | `graphene-django <https:/                       |\n|                   | /github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django/>`__ |\n+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+\n| SQLAlchemy        | `graphene-sqlalchemy <https://git               |\n|                   | hub.com/graphql-python/graphene-sqlalchemy/>`__ |\n+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+\n\nAlso, Graphene is fully compatible with the GraphQL spec, working\nseamlessly with all GraphQL clients, such as\n`Relay <https://github.com/facebook/relay>`__,\n`Apollo <https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client>`__ and\n`gql <https://github.com/graphql-python/gql>`__.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install `graphene`, just run this command in your shell\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   pip install \"graphene>=3.0\"\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nHere is one example for you to get started:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   import graphene\n\n   class Query(graphene.ObjectType):\n       hello = graphene.String(description='A typical hello world')\n\n       def resolve_hello(self, info):\n           return 'World'\n\n   schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)\n\nThen Querying ``graphene.Schema`` is as simple as:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   query = '''\n       query SayHello {\n         hello\n       }\n   '''\n   result = schema.execute(query)\n\nIf you want to learn even more, you can also check the following\n`examples <examples/>`__:\n\n-  **Basic Schema**: `Starwars example <examples/starwars>`__\n-  **Relay Schema**: `Starwars Relay\n   example <examples/starwars_relay>`__\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation and links to additional resources are available at\nhttps://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nAfter cloning this repo, create a\n`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ and ensure\ndependencies are installed by running:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   virtualenv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -e \".[test]\"\n\nWell-written tests and maintaining good test coverage is important to\nthis project. While developing, run new and existing tests with:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   py.test graphene/relay/tests/test_node.py # Single file\n   py.test graphene/relay # All tests in directory\n\nAdd the ``-s`` flag if you have introduced breakpoints into the code for\ndebugging. Add the ``-v`` (���verbose���) flag to get more detailed test\noutput. For even more detailed output, use ``-vv``. Check out the\n`pytest documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__ for more\noptions and test running controls.\n\nYou can also run the benchmarks with:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   py.test graphene --benchmark-only\n\nGraphene supports several versions of Python. To make sure that changes\ndo not break compatibility with any of those versions, we use ``tox`` to\ncreate virtualenvs for each Python version and run tests with that\nversion. To run against all Python versions defined in the ``tox.ini``\nconfig file, just run:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   tox\n\nIf you wish to run against a specific version defined in the ``tox.ini``\nfile:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   tox -e py36\n\nTox can only use whatever versions of Python are installed on your\nsystem. When you create a pull request, Travis will also be running the\nsame tests and report the results, so there is no need for potential\ncontributors to try to install every single version of Python on their\nown system ahead of time. We appreciate opening issues and pull requests\nto make graphene even more stable & useful!\n\nBuilding Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe documentation is generated using the excellent\n`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and a custom theme.\n\nAn HTML version of the documentation is produced by running:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   make docs\n\n.. |Graphene Logo| image:: http://graphene-python.org/favicon.png\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/graphql-python/graphene.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/graphql-python/graphene\n.. |PyPI version| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/graphene.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/graphene\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/graphql-python/graphene/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/graphql-python/graphene?branch=master\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/82/75/02875858c7c09fc156840181cdee27b23408fac75720a2e1e9128f3d48a5/graphene-3.3.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-Present Syrus Akbary\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Increases in the major version of GraphQL.js are reflected in the minor version of GraphQL-core instead. This means there can be breaking changes in the API when the minor version changes, and only patch releases are fully backward compatible. Therefore, we recommend something like `=~ 3.2.0` as version specifier when including GraphQL-core as a dependency.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nA more detailed documentation for GraphQL-core 3 can be found at\n[graphql-core-3.readthedocs.io](https://graphql-core-3.readthedocs.io/).\n\nThe documentation for GraphQL.js can be found at [graphql.org/graphql-js/](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/).\n\nThe documentation for GraphQL itself can be found at [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/).\n\nThere will be also [blog articles](https://cito.github.io/tags/graphql/) with more usage\nexamples.\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nA general overview of GraphQL is available in the\n[README](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/README.md) for the\n[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec). That overview\ndescribes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](tests) in this\nrepository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk through that\nREADME and the corresponding tests in parallel.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nGraphQL-core 3 can be installed from PyPI using the built-in pip command:\n\n    python -m pip install graphql-core\n\nYou can also use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for installation in a\nvirtual environment:\n\n    poetry install\n\n\n## Usage\n\nGraphQL-core provides two important capabilities: building a type schema and\nserving queries against that type schema.\n\nFirst, build a GraphQL type schema which maps to your codebase:\n\n```python\nfrom graphql import (\n    GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLField, GraphQLString)\n\nschema = GraphQLSchema(\n    query=GraphQLObjectType(\n        name='RootQueryType',\n        fields={\n            'hello': GraphQLField(\n                GraphQLString,\n                resolve=lambda obj, info: 'world')\n        }))\n```\n\nThis defines a simple schema, with one type and one field, that resolves to a fixed\nvalue. The `resolve` function can return a value, a co-routine object or a list of\nthese. It takes two positional arguments; the first one provides the root or the\nresolved parent field, the second one provides a `GraphQLResolveInfo` object which\ncontains information about the execution state of the query, including a `context`\nattribute holding per-request state such as authentication information or database\nsession. Any GraphQL arguments are passed to the `resolve` functions as individual\nkeyword arguments.\n\nNote that the signature of the resolver functions is a bit different in GraphQL.js,\nwhere the context is passed separately and arguments are passed as a single object.\nAlso note that GraphQL fields must be passed as a `GraphQLField` object explicitly.\nSimilarly, GraphQL arguments must be passed as `GraphQLArgument` objects.\n\nA more complex example is included in the top-level [tests](tests) directory.\n\nThen, serve the result of a query against that type schema.\n\n```python\nfrom graphql import graphql_sync\n\nsource = '{ hello }'\n\nprint(graphql_sync(schema, source))\n```\n\nThis runs a query fetching the one field defined, and then prints the result:\n\n```python\nExecutionResult(data={'hello': 'world'}, errors=None)\n```\n\nThe `graphql_sync` function will first ensure the query is syntactically and\nsemantically valid before executing it, reporting errors otherwise.\n\n```python\nfrom graphql import graphql_sync\n\nsource = '{ BoyHowdy }'\n\nprint(graphql_sync(schema, source))\n```\n\nBecause we queried a non-existing field, we will get the following result:\n\n```python\nExecutionResult(data=None, errors=[GraphQLError(\n    \"Cannot query field 'BoyHowdy' on type 'RootQueryType'.\",\n    locations=[SourceLocation(line=1, column=3)])])\n```\n\nThe `graphql_sync` function assumes that all resolvers return values synchronously. By\nusing coroutines as resolvers, you can also create results in an asynchronous fashion\nwith the `graphql` function.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom graphql import (\n    graphql, GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLField, GraphQLString)\n\n\nasync def resolve_hello(obj, info):\n    await asyncio.sleep(3)\n    return 'world'\n\nschema = GraphQLSchema(\n    query=GraphQLObjectType(\n        name='RootQueryType',\n        fields={\n            'hello': GraphQLField(\n                GraphQLString,\n                resolve=resolve_hello)\n        }))\n\n\nasync def main():\n    query = '{ hello }'\n    print('Fetching the result...')\n    result = await graphql(schema, query)\n    print(result)\n\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n\n## Goals and restrictions\n\nGraphQL-core tries to reproduce the code of the reference implementation GraphQL.js\nin Python as closely as possible and to stay up-to-date with the latest development of\nGraphQL.js.\n\nGraphQL-core 3 (formerly known as GraphQL-core-next) has been created as a modern\nalternative to [GraphQL-core 2](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-legacy),\na prior work by Syrus Akbary, based on an older version of GraphQL.js and also\ntargeting older Python versions. Some parts of GraphQL-core 3 have been inspired by\nGraphQL-core 2 or directly taken over with only slight modifications, but most of the\ncode has been re-implemented from scratch, replicating the latest code in GraphQL.js\nvery closely and adding type hints for Python.\n\nDesign goals for the GraphQL-core 3 library were:\n\n* to be a simple, cruft-free, state-of-the-art GraphQL implementation for current\n  Python versions\n* to be very close to the GraphQL.js reference implementation, while still providing\n  a Pythonic API and code style\n* to make extensive use of Python type hints, similar to how GraphQL.js used Flow\n  (and is now using TypeScript)\n* to use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to achieve a consistent code style\n  while saving time and mental energy for more important matters\n* to replicate the complete Mocha-based test suite of GraphQL.js\n  using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)\n  with [pytest-describe](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-describe/)\n\nSome restrictions (mostly in line with the design goals):\n\n* requires Python 3.6 or newer\n* does not support some already deprecated methods and options of GraphQL.js\n* supports asynchronous operations only via async.io\n  (does not support the additional executors in GraphQL-core)\n\n\n## Integration with other libraries and roadmap\n\n* [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/) is a more high-level framework for building\n  GraphQL APIs in Python, and there is already a whole ecosystem of libraries, server\n  integrations and tools built on top of Graphene. Most of this Graphene ecosystem has\n  also been created by Syrus Akbary, who meanwhile has handed over the maintenance\n  and future development to members of the GraphQL-Python community.\n\n  The current version 2 of Graphene is using Graphql-core 2 as core library for much of\n  the heavy lifting. Note that Graphene 2 is not compatible with GraphQL-core 3.\n  The  new version 3 of Graphene will use GraphQL-core 3 instead of GraphQL-core 2.\n\n* [Ariadne](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne) is a Python library for implementing\n  GraphQL servers using schema-first approach created by Mirumee Software.\n\n  Ariadne is already using GraphQL-core 3 as its GraphQL implementation.\n\n* [Strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry), created by Patrick\n  Arminio, is a new GraphQL library for Python 3, inspired by dataclasses,\n  that is also using GraphQL-core 3 as underpinning.\n\n\n## Changelog\n\nChanges are tracked as\n[GitHub releases](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/releases).\n\n\n## Credits and history\n\nThe GraphQL-core 3 library\n* has been created and is maintained by Christoph Zwerschke\n* uses ideas and code from GraphQL-core 2, a prior work by Syrus Akbary\n* is a Python port of GraphQL.js which has been developed by Lee Byron and others\n  at Facebook, Inc. and is now maintained\n  by the [GraphQL foundation](https://gql.foundation/join/)\n\nPlease watch the recording of Lee Byron's short keynote on the\n[history of GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjHWkBr3tjI)\nat the open source leadership summit 2019 to better understand\nhow and why GraphQL was created at Facebook and then became open sourced\nand ported to many different programming languages.\n\n\n## License\n\nGraphQL-core 3 is\n[MIT-licensed](./LICENSE),\njust like GraphQL.js.\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/a6/94df9045ca1bac404c7b394094cd06713f63f49c7a4d54d99b773ae81737/graphql-core-3.2.3.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) GraphQL Contributors (GraphQL.js)\nCopyright (c) Syrus Akbary (GraphQL-core 2)\nCopyright (c) Christoph Zwerschke (GraphQL-core 3)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

`connection_args` returns the arguments that fields should provide when\nthey return a connection type that supports bidirectional pagination.\n - `forward_connection_args` returns the arguments that fields should provide when\nthey return a connection type that only supports forward pagination.\n - `backward_connection_args` returns the arguments that fields should provide when\nthey return a connection type that only supports backward pagination.\n - `connection_definitions` returns a `connection_type` and its associated\n`edgeType`, given a name and a node type.\n - `connection_from_array` is a helper method that takes an array and the\narguments from `connection_args`, does pagination and filtering, and returns\nan object in the shape expected by a `connection_type`'s `resolve` function.\n - `cursor_for_object_in_connection` is a helper method that takes an array and a\nmember object, and returns a cursor for use in the mutation payload.\n - `offset_to_cursor` takes the index of a member object in an array\n and returns an opaque cursor for use in the mutation payload.\n - `cursor_to_offset` takes an opaque cursor (created with `offset_to_cursor`)\nand returns the corresponding array index.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](tests/star_wars_schema.py):\n\n```python\nship_edge, ship_connection = connection_definitions(ship_type, \"Ship\")\n\nfaction_type = GraphQLObjectType(\n    name=\"Faction\",\n    description=\"A faction in the Star Wars saga\",\n    fields=lambda: {\n        \"id\": global_id_field(\"Faction\"),\n        \"name\": GraphQLField(GraphQLString, description=\"The name of the faction.\"),\n        \"ships\": GraphQLField(\n            ship_connection,\n            description=\"The ships used by the faction.\",\n            args=connection_args,\n            resolve=lambda faction, _info, **args: connection_from_array(\n                [get_ship(ship) for ship in faction.ships], args\n            ),\n        ),\n    },\n    interfaces=[node_interface],\n)\n```\n\nThis shows adding a `ships` field to the `Faction` object that is a connection.\nIt uses `connection_definitions(ship_type, \"Ship\")` to create the connection\ntype, adds `connection_args` as arguments on this function, and then implements\nthe resolver function by passing the array of ships and the arguments to\n`connection_from_array`.\n\n### Object Identification\n\nHelper functions are provided for both building the GraphQL types\nfor nodes and for implementing global IDs around local IDs.\n\n - `node_definitions` returns the `Node` interface that objects can implement,\n    and returns the `node` root field to include on the query type.\n    To implement this, it takes a function to resolve an ID to an object,\n    and to determine the type of a given object.\n - `to_global_id` takes a type name and an ID specific to that type name,\n    and returns a \"global ID\" that is unique among all types.\n - `from_global_id` takes the \"global ID\" created by `to_global_id`, and\n    returns the type name and ID used to create it.\n - `global_id_field` creates the configuration for an `id` field on a node.\n - `plural_identifying_root_field` creates a field that accepts a list of\n    non-ID identifiers (like a username) and maps then to their corresponding\n    objects.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](tests/star_wars_schema.py):\n\n```python\ndef get_node(global_id, _info):\n    type_, id_ = from_global_id(global_id)\n    if type_ == \"Faction\":\n        return get_faction(id_)\n    if type_ == \"Ship\":\n        return get_ship(id_)\n    return None  # pragma: no cover\n\ndef get_node_type(obj, _info, _type):\n    if isinstance(obj, Faction):\n        return faction_type.name\n    return ship_type.name\n\nnode_interface, node_field = node_definitions(get_node, get_node_type)[:2]\n\nfaction_type = GraphQLObjectType(\n    name=\"Faction\",\n    description=\"A faction in the Star Wars saga\",\n    fields=lambda: {\n        \"id\": global_id_field(\"Faction\"),\n        \"name\": GraphQLField(GraphQLString, description=\"The name of the faction.\"),\n        \"ships\": GraphQLField(\n            ship_connection,\n            description=\"The ships used by the faction.\",\n            args=connection_args,\n            resolve=lambda faction, _info, **args: connection_from_array(\n                [get_ship(ship) for ship in faction.ships], args\n            ),\n        ),\n    },\n    interfaces=[node_interface],\n)\n\nquery_type = GraphQLObjectType(\n    name=\"Query\",\n    fields=lambda: {\n        \"rebels\": GraphQLField(faction_type, resolve=lambda _obj, _info: get_rebels()),\n        \"empire\": GraphQLField(faction_type, resolve=lambda _obj, _info: get_empire()),\n        \"node\": node_field,\n    },\n)\n```\n\nThis uses `node_definitions` to construct the `Node` interface and the `node`\nfield; it uses `from_global_id` to resolve the IDs passed in the implementation\nof the function mapping ID to object. It then uses the `global_id_field` method to\ncreate the `id` field on `Faction`, which also ensures implements the\n`node_interface`. Finally, it adds the `node` field to the query type, using the\n`node_field` returned by `node_definitions`.\n\n### Mutations\n\nA helper function is provided for building mutations with\nsingle inputs and client mutation IDs.\n\n - `mutation_with_client_mutation_id` takes a name, input fields, output fields,\nand a mutation method to map from the input fields to the output fields,\nperforming the mutation along the way. It then creates and returns a field\nconfiguration that can be used as a top-level field on the mutation type.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](tests/star_wars_schema.py):\n\n```python\nclass IntroduceShipMutation:\n\n    def __init__(self, shipId, factionId, clientMutationId=None):\n        self.shipId = shipId\n        self.factionId = factionId\n        self.clientMutationId = clientMutationId\n\ndef mutate_and_get_payload(_info, shipName, factionId, **_input):\n    new_ship = create_ship(shipName, factionId)\n    return IntroduceShipMutation(shipId=new_ship.id, factionId=factionId)\n\nship_mutation = mutation_with_client_mutation_id(\n    \"IntroduceShip\",\n    input_fields={\n        \"shipName\": GraphQLInputField(GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)),\n        \"factionId\": GraphQLInputField(GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID)),\n    },\n    output_fields={\n        \"ship\": GraphQLField(\n            ship_type, resolve=lambda payload, _info: get_ship(payload.shipId)\n        ),\n        \"faction\": GraphQLField(\n            faction_type, resolve=lambda payload, _info: get_faction(payload.factionId)\n        ),\n    },\n    mutate_and_get_payload=mutate_and_get_payload,\n)\n\nmutation_type = GraphQLObjectType(\n    \"Mutation\", fields=lambda: {\"introduceShip\": ship_mutation}\n)\n```\n\nThis code creates a mutation named `IntroduceShip`, which takes a faction\nID and a ship name as input. It outputs the `Faction` and the `Ship` in\nquestion. `mutate_and_get_payload` then gets each input field as keyword\nparameter, performs the mutation by constructing the new ship, then returns\nan object that will be resolved by the output fields.\n\nOur mutation type then creates the `introduceShip` field using the return\nvalue of `mutation_with_client_mutation_id`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAfter cloning this repository from GitHub,\nwe recommend using [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)\nto create a test environment.

This file is included into docs/history.rst\n\n\nGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent\nprogramming.\n\nThe \"greenlet\" package is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version of\nCPython that supports micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run\npseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)\nand are synchronized with data exchanges on \"channels\".\n\nA \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of\nmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.\nThis is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.\nYou can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;\nhowever, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to\nmake advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreate\ngenerators; the difference with Python's own generators is that our\ngenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions can\nyield values too.

This is the latest version of\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna2008'))\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna2008'))\n    домен.испытание\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping that was developed by the\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementers should use transitional processing with caution, only in\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\nresults.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\nmodule name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\n\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\n  While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable\n  issues being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your\n  requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bf/3f/ea4b9117521a1e9c50344b909be7886dd00a519552724809bb1f486986c2/idna-3.6.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"BSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2023, Kim Davies and contributors.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n1.

See the\n  instructions in the `Building the docs`_ section for details.\n\nWorkflow to contribute\n======================\n\nTo contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github\n<https://github.com/>`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository\n<https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_ to have your own repository,\nclone it using 'git clone' on the computers where you want to work. Make\nyour changes in your clone, push them to your github account, test them\non several computers, and when you are happy with them, send a pull\nrequest to the main repository.\n\nRunning the test suite\n======================\n\nTo run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.\nRun the test suite using::\n\n    pytest joblib\n\nfrom the root of the project.\n\nBuilding the docs\n=================\n\nTo build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4) and some dependencies\ninstalled::\n\n    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txt\n\nThe docs can then be built with the following command::\n\n    make doc\n\nThe html docs are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.\n\n\nMaking a source tarball\n=======================\n\nTo create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the\nfollowing command::\n\n    python setup.py sdist\n\nThe tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will\ncompile the docs, and the resulting tarball can be installed with\nno extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You will need\nsetuptool and sphinx.\n\nMaking a release and uploading it to PyPI\n=========================================\n\nThis command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and\nupload in to PyPI::\n\n    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n    twine upload dist/*\n\n\nNote that the documentation should automatically get updated at each git\npush. If that is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolve\nany doc build error (in particular when running the examples).\n\nUpdating the changelog\n======================\n\nChanges are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updated\nbut, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::\n\n    git log --abbrev-commit --date=short --no-merges --sparse\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/15/0f/d3b33b9f106dddef461f6df1872b7881321b247f3d255b87f61a7636f7fe/joblib-1.3.2.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"BSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2021, The joblib developers.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

Conceptually, Mako is an embedded \nPython (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas\nof componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most \nstraightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close \nties to Python calling and scoping semantics.\n\nNutshell\n========\n\n::\n\n    <%inherit file=\"base.html\"/>\n    <%\n        rows = [[v for v in range(0,10)] for row in range(0,10)]\n    %>\n    <table>\n        % for row in rows:\n            ${makerow(row)}\n        % endfor\n    </table>\n\n    <%def name=\"makerow(row)\">\n        <tr>\n        % for name in row:\n            <td>${name}</td>\\\n        % endfor\n        </tr>\n    </%def>\n\nPhilosophy\n===========\n\nPython is a great scripting language.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.\n","name":"CC0-1.0"},{"attribution":"License agreement for matplotlib versions 1.3.0 and later\n=========================================================\n\n1.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n   g.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

Distribution Obligations.\n      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n         (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n         (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Application of this License.\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n   6. Versions of the License.\n      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n         [1] A Developer specific license.\n         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n   8. TERMINATION.\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.","name":"OPL-1.0"}],"notes":[],"otherLicenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2022-2023 Intel Corporation\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.","name":"Apache-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2022 Intel Corporation\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.","name":"GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception"},{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 2011-2014 The OpenBLAS Project\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 3 or any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\").

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4.

Open Publication works are licensed and provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.\n\n\nIV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS\n\nAll modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements:\n\n   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.\n   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.\n   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.\n   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.\n   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's (or authors') permission. \n\n\nV. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\n\n   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\n   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\n   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s). \n\n\nVI. LICENSE OPTIONS\n\nThe author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.\n\nA. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the explicit permission of the author(s). \"Substantive modification\" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\nB. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\n\nOPEN PUBLICATION POLICY APPENDIX:\n\n(This is not considered part of the license.)\n\nOpen Publication works are available in source format via the Open Publication home page at http://works.opencontent.org/.\n\nOpen Publication authors who want to include their own license on Open Publication works may do so, as long as their terms are not more restrictive than the Open Publication license.\n\nIf you have questions about the Open Publication License, please contact David Wiley, and/or the Open Publication Authors' List at opal@opencontent.org, via email.\n\nTo subscribe to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"subscribe\" in the body.\n\nTo post to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal@opencontent.org or simply reply to a previous post.\n\nTo unsubscribe from the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"unsubscribe\" in the body.","name":"openpub"},{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 1993 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)\n- [python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\n- [pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations](https://github.com/stub42/pytz)\n\nSee the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.\n\n## Installation from sources\nTo install pandas from source you need [Cython](https://cython.org/) in addition to the normal\ndependencies above.

internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.\n\nThe core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.\n\n## More Information\n\n- [Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)\n  - [Installation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\n  - [Handbook](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/index.html)\n- [Contribute](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n  - [Issues](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues)\n  - [Pull requests](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pulls)\n- [Release notes](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/index.html)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/CHANGES.rst)\n  - [Pre-fork](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#pre-fork)\n\n## Report a Vulnerability\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please follow the procedure described in the [Tidelift security policy](https://tidelift.com/docs/security).\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f8/3e/32cbd0129a28686621434cbf17bb64bf1458bfb838f1f668262fefce145c/pillow-10.2.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"The Python Imaging Library (PIL) is\n\n    Copyright © 1997-2011 by Secret Labs AB\n    Copyright © 1995-2011 by Fredrik Lundh\n\nPillow is the friendly PIL fork.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d.

The pyparsing module provides a library of\nclasses that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in\nPython code.\n\n*[Since first writing this description of pyparsing in late 2003, this\ntechnique for developing parsers has become more widespread, under the\nname Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more information on PEGs*\n`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>`__\n*.]*\n\nHere is a program to parse ``\"Hello, World!\"`` (or any greeting of the form\n``\"salutation, addressee!\"``):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from pyparsing import Word, alphas\n    greet = Word(alphas) + \",\" + Word(alphas) + \"!\"\n    hello = \"Hello, World!\"\n    print(hello, \"->\", greet.parseString(hello))\n\nThe program outputs the following::\n\n    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']\n\nThe Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the\nself-explanatory class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operator\ndefinitions.\n\nThe parsed results returned from ``parseString()`` is a collection of type\n``ParseResults``, which can be accessed as a\nnested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.\n\nThe pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically\nvexing when writing text parsers:\n\n- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle ``\"Hello,World!\"``, ``\"Hello , World !\"``, etc.)\n- quoted strings\n- embedded comments\n\nThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple CORBA IDL\nparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-\nfunction algebraic notation parser, among many others.\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThere are many examples in the online docstrings of the classes\nand methods in pyparsing. You can find them compiled into `online docs <https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. Additional\ndocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online\n`GitHub wiki <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/wiki>`__.

For more examples, look at the documentation.\n\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\ndate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n    >>> from datetime import *\n    >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n    >>> today = now.date()\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n    >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\n    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n    >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n    >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).

This library allows\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\n\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\n\n.. note::\n\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\nstandard Python distutils.\n\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\n\n    pip install pytz\n\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\nadministrative user::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\npytz for Enterprise\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.\n\n\nExample & Usage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLocalized times and date arithmetic\n-----------------------------------\n\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n>>> from pytz import timezone\n>>> import pytz\n>>> utc = pytz.utc\n>>> utc.zone\n'UTC'\n>>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')\n>>> eastern.zone\n'US/Eastern'\n>>> amsterdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')\n>>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z'\n\nThis library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\ninformation):\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\n\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\n\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\n\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Does not work this way!\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\n\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\nas UTC:\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Not recommended except for UTC\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\n\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\nby humans.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\n\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\ntimezone.\n\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\n\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\nsection for more details)\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\nstandard astimezone method.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\nTrue\n\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\ndeal with.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n\n\n``tzinfo`` API\n--------------\n\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\n\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\n\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\n\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used\nduring DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds\n3600\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 20:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\ndatetime.timedelta(0)\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\n'NST'\n\nIf ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise\nan ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError`` exception.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> import pytz.exceptions\n>>> try:\n...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.dst(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n\n\nProblems with Localtime\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes\nmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\nhappens:\n\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\n\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\n\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\n\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\n\n>>> import pickle, pytz\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\n17\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\n>>> new == dt\nTrue\n>>> new is dt\nFalse\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\nTrue\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\nTrue\n\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\nnot compare the same in Python.\n\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\nFalse\n\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\n\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\n\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\n\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\ntimes.\n\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\nTime:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\n\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\nthe entire hour:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\n\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\neasier:\n\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n\n\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\n\n\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\n'0:24:01'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\n'0:00:01'\n\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\n\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\nincluded for tests only!):\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\n>>> str(dt)\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\n\nNotice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are\ncorrect, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are\nactually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00'\n>>> str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00'\n\n\nCountry Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use\nfor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.\nIt returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant\ntzinfo instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:\n\n>>> print(' '.join(pytz.country_timezones['nz']))\nPacific/Auckland Pacific/Chatham\n\nThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country\nname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:\n\n>>> print(pytz.country_names['nz'])\nNew Zealand\n\n\nWhat is UTC\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n'UTC' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It is a successor to, but distinct\nfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal\nTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time\nmeasurement.\n\nAll other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like\nUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No\ndaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform\ndate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused\nby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or\nmobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.\n\n..  _Coordinated Universal Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\n\n\nHelpers\n~~~~~~~\n\nThere are two lists of timezones provided.\n\n``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can\nbe used.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones\n>>> len(all_timezones) >= 500\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in all_timezones\nTrue\n\n``common_timezones`` is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn't\ncontain deprecated zones or historical zones, except for a few I've\ndeemed in common usage, such as US/Eastern (open a bug report if you\nthink other timezones are deserving of being included here). It is also\na sequence of strings.\n\n>>> from pytz import common_timezones\n>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in common_timezones\nFalse\n>>> 'Australia/Melbourne' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Canada/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in all_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in common_timezones\nFalse\n\nBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are alphabetically\nsorted:\n\n>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]\n>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> common_timezones == common_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]\n>>> all_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n\n``all_timezones`` and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set, common_timezones_set\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in all_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Victoria' in common_timezones_set\nFalse\n\nYou can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countries\nusing the ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166\ntwo letter country code.\n\n>>> from pytz import country_timezones\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('ch')))\nEurope/Zurich\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('CH')))\nEurope/Zurich\n\n\nInternationalization - i18n/l10n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPytz is an interface to the IANA database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium's Unicode Locales (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_\nproject provides translations. Python packages such as\n`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_\nand Thomas Khyn's `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be used\nto access these translations from Python.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nMIT license.\n\nThis code is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope Public\nLicense,  Version 2.1 (ZPL).\n\nI'm happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in other\nopen source projects.\n\n\nLatest Versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package will be updated after releases of the Olson timezone\ndatabase.  The latest version can be downloaded from the `Python Package\nIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The code that is used\nto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and available\nusing git::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.git\n\nAnnouncements of new releases are made on\n`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the\n`Atom feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_\nhosted there.\n\n\nBugs, Feature Requests & Patches\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBugs should be reported on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.\nFeature requests are unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directed\nto timezone support now built into Python or packages that work with it.\n\n\nSecurity Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReports about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.\n\n\nIssues & Limitations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects using Python 3.9 or later\n  are best served by using the timezone functionaly now included in core\n  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n\n- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the nearest whole minute, so timezones\n  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will be up to 30 seconds out. This\n  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.\n\n- If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can't fix\n  it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and\n  changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.\n  If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing\n  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMore info than you want to know about timezones:\nhttps://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html\n\n\nContact\n~~~~~~~\n\nStuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ae/fd/c5bafe60236bc2a464452f916b6a1806257109c8954d6a7d19e5d4fb012f/pytz-2023.4.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2003-2019 Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This sometimes happens in environments that\r\ncome with pywin32 pre-shipped (eg, anaconda?).\r\n\r\nThe possible solutions are:\r\n\r\n* Run the \"post_install\" script documented above.\r\n\r\n* Otherwise, find and remove all other copies of `pywintypesXX.dll` and `pythoncomXX.dll`\r\n  (where `XX` is the Python version - eg, \"39\")\r\n\r\n### Running as a Windows Service\r\n\r\nModern Python installers do not, by default, install Python in a way that is suitable for\r\nrunning as a service, particularly for other users.\r\n\r\n* Ensure Python is installed in a location where the user running the service has\r\n  access to the installation and is able to load `pywintypesXX.dll` and `pythonXX.dll`.\r\n\r\n* Manually copy `pythonservice.exe` from the `site-packages/win32` directory to\r\n  the same place as these DLLs.\r\n\r\n## Building from source\r\n\r\nInstall Visual Studio 2019 (later probably works, but options might be different),\r\nselect \"Desktop Development with C++\", then the following options:\r\n* Windows 10 SDK (latest offered I guess? At time of writing, 10.0.18362)\r\n* \"C++ for MFC for ...\"\r\n* ARM build tools if necessary.\r\n\r\n(the free compilers probably work too, but haven't been tested - let me know your experiences!)\r\n\r\n`setup.py` is a standard distutils build script, so you probably want:\r\n\r\n> python setup.py install\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n> python setup.py --help\r\n\r\nSome modules need obscure SDKs to build - `setup.py` should succeed, gracefully\r\ntelling you why it failed to build them - if the build actually fails with your\r\nconfiguration, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/issues).\r\n\r\n## Release process\r\n\r\nThe following steps are performed when making a new release - this is mainly\r\nto form a checklist so mhammond doesn't forget what to do :)\r\n\r\n* Ensure CHANGES.txt has everything worth noting, commit it.\r\n\r\n* Update setup.py with the new build number.\r\n\r\n* Execute build.bat, wait forever, test the artifacts.\r\n\r\n* Upload .whl artifacts to pypi - we do this before pushing the tag because they might be\r\n  rejected for an invalid `README.md`. Done via `py -3.? -m twine upload dist/*XXX*.whl`.\r\n\r\n* Commit setup.py (so the new build number is in the repo), create a new git tag\r\n\r\n* Upload the .exe installers to github.\r\n\r\n* Update setup.py with the new build number + \".1\" (eg, 123.1), to ensure\r\n  future test builds aren't mistaken for the real release.\r\n\r\n* Make sure everything is pushed to github, including the tag (ie,\r\n  `git push --tags`)\r\n\r\n* Send mail to python-win32\r\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/08/dc/28c668097edfaf4eac4617ef7adf081b9cf50d254672fcf399a70f5efc41/pywin32-306-cp310-cp310-win32.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[],"notes":[],"otherLicenses":[{"attribution":"Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this software is granted provided this copyright notice appears in all copies.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n   1. Definitions\n      a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n      b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n      c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n      d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n      e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n      f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n   2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n      c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n      d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n         ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n      f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n      b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2.

On 32 bit systems, the amount of memory you can have mapped at a time is naturally limited to theoretical 4GB of memory, which may not be enough for some applications.\n\n\n## Limitations\n\n* **System resources (file-handles) are likely to be leaked!** This is due to the library authors reliance on a deterministic `__del__()` destructor.\n* The memory access is read-only by design.\n\n\n## Overview\n\n![Python package](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)\n\nSmmap wraps an interface around mmap and tracks the mapped files as well as the amount of clients who use it. If the system runs out of resources, or if a memory limit is reached, it will automatically unload unused maps to allow continued operation.\n\nTo allow processing large files even on 32 bit systems, it allows only portions of the file to be mapped. Once the user reads beyond the mapped region, smmap will automatically map the next required region, unloading unused regions using a LRU algorithm.\n\nAlthough the library can be used most efficiently with its native interface, a Buffer implementation is provided to hide these details behind a simple string-like interface.\n\nFor performance critical 64 bit applications, a simplified version of memory mapping is provided which always maps the whole file, but still provides the benefit of unloading unused mappings on demand.\n\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.7+\n* OSX, Windows or Linux\n\nThe package was tested on all of the previously mentioned configurations.\n\n## Installing smmap\n\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/smmap/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/smmap/?badge=latest)\n\nIts easiest to install smmap using the [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest) program:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install smmap\n```\n\nAs the command will install smmap in your respective python distribution, you will most likely need root permissions to authorize the required changes.\n\nIf you have downloaded the source archive, the package can be installed by running the `setup.py` script:\n\n```bash\n$ python setup.py install\n```\n\nIt is advised to have a look at the **Usage Guide** for a brief introduction on the different database implementations.\n\n\n\n## Homepage and Links\n\nThe project is home on github at https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap .\n\nThe latest source can be cloned from github as well:\n\n* git://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap.git\n\n\nFor support, please use the git-python mailing list:\n\n* http://groups.google.com/group/git-python\n\n\nIssues can be filed on github:\n\n* https://github.com/gitpython-developers/smmap/issues\n\nA link to the pypi page related to this repository:\n\n* https://pypi.org/project/smmap/\n\n\n## License Information\n\n*smmap* is licensed under the New BSD License.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/88/04/b5bf6d21dc4041000ccba7eb17dd3055feb237e7ffc2c20d3fae3af62baa/smmap-5.0.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 2010, 2011 Sebastian Thiel and contributors\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without \nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions \nare met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright \nnotice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright \nnotice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the \ndocumentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of the async project nor the names of \nits contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived \nfrom this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \n\"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT \nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR \nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

SQLAlchemy provides a full suite\nof well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,\ndesigned for efficient and high-performing database\naccess, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain\nlanguage.\n\nMajor SQLAlchemy features include:\n\n* An industrial strength ORM, built\n  from the core on the identity map, unit of work,\n  and data mapper patterns.   These patterns\n  allow transparent persistence of objects\n  using a declarative configuration system.\n  Domain models\n  can be constructed and manipulated naturally,\n  and changes are synchronized with the\n  current transaction automatically.\n* A relationally-oriented query system, exposing\n  the full range of SQL's capabilities\n  explicitly, including joins, subqueries,\n  correlation, and most everything else,\n  in terms of the object model.\n  Writing queries with the ORM uses the same\n  techniques of relational composition you use\n  when writing SQL.  While you can drop into\n  literal SQL at any time, it's virtually never\n  needed.\n* A comprehensive and flexible system\n  of eager loading for related collections and objects.\n  Collections are cached within a session,\n  and can be loaded on individual access, all\n  at once using joins, or by query per collection\n  across the full result set.\n* A Core SQL construction system and DBAPI\n  interaction layer.  The SQLAlchemy Core is\n  separate from the ORM and is a full database\n  abstraction layer in its own right, and includes\n  an extensible Python-based SQL expression\n  language, schema metadata, connection pooling,\n  type coercion, and custom types.\n* All primary and foreign key constraints are\n  assumed to be composite and natural.  Surrogate\n  integer primary keys are of course still the\n  norm, but SQLAlchemy never assumes or hardcodes\n  to this model.\n* Database introspection and generation.  Database\n  schemas can be \"reflected\" in one step into\n  Python structures representing database metadata;\n  those same structures can then generate\n  CREATE statements right back out - all within\n  the Core, independent of the ORM.\n\nSQLAlchemy's philosophy:\n\n* SQL databases behave less and less like object\n  collections the more size and performance start to\n  matter; object collections behave less and less like\n  tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.\n  SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate both of these\n  principles.\n* An ORM doesn't need to hide the \"R\".   A relational\n  database provides rich, set-based functionality\n  that should be fully exposed.   SQLAlchemy's\n  ORM provides an open-ended set of patterns\n  that allow a developer to construct a custom\n  mediation layer between a domain model and\n  a relational schema, turning the so-called\n  \"object relational impedance\" issue into\n  a distant memory.\n* The developer, in all cases, makes all decisions\n  regarding the design, structure, and naming conventions\n  of both the object model as well as the relational\n  schema.   SQLAlchemy only provides the means\n  to automate the execution of these decisions.\n* With SQLAlchemy, there's no such thing as\n  \"the ORM generated a bad query\" - you\n  retain full control over the structure of\n  queries, including how joins are organized,\n  how subqueries and correlation is used, what\n  columns are requested.  Everything SQLAlchemy\n  does is ultimately the result of a developer-initiated \n  decision.\n* Don't use an ORM if the problem doesn't need one.\n  SQLAlchemy consists of a Core and separate ORM\n  component.   The Core offers a full SQL expression\n  language that allows Pythonic construction\n  of SQL constructs that render directly to SQL\n  strings for a target database, returning\n  result sets that are essentially enhanced DBAPI\n  cursors.\n* Transactions should be the norm.  With SQLAlchemy's\n  ORM, nothing goes to permanent storage until\n  commit() is called.  SQLAlchemy encourages applications\n  to create a consistent means of delineating\n  the start and end of a series of operations.\n* Never render a literal value in a SQL statement.\n  Bound parameters are used to the greatest degree\n  possible, allowing query optimizers to cache\n  query plans effectively and making SQL injection\n  attacks a non-issue.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nLatest documentation is at:\n\nhttps://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/\n\nInstallation / Requirements\n---------------------------\n\nFull documentation for installation is at\n`Installation <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/intro.html#installation>`_.\n\nGetting Help / Development / Bug reporting\n------------------------------------------\n\nPlease refer to the `SQLAlchemy Community Guide <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html>`_.\n\nCode of Conduct\n---------------\n\nAbove all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\nPlease see our current Code of Conduct at\n`Code of Conduct <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSQLAlchemy is distributed under the `MIT license\n<https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b9/fc/327f0072d1f5231d61c715ad52cb7819ec60f0ac80dc1e507bc338919caa/SQLAlchemy-2.0.27.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2005-2024 SQLAlchemy authors and contributors <see AUTHORS file>.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If some of the packages are missing,\na warning message is displayed on STDERR.\n\n### Python Runtime Programmatic Introspection\n\nIntrospect the current state of the threadpool-enabled runtime libraries\nthat are loaded when importing Python packages:\n\n```python\n>>> from threadpoolctl import threadpool_info\n>>> from pprint import pprint\n>>> pprint(threadpool_info())\n[]\n\n>>> import numpy\n>>> pprint(threadpool_info())\n[{'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so',\n  'internal_api': 'mkl',\n  'num_threads': 2,\n  'prefix': 'libmkl_rt',\n  'threading_layer': 'intel',\n  'user_api': 'blas',\n  'version': '2019.0.4'},\n {'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so',\n  'internal_api': 'openmp',\n  'num_threads': 4,\n  'prefix': 'libiomp',\n  'user_api': 'openmp',\n  'version': None}]\n\n>>> import xgboost\n>>> pprint(threadpool_info())\n[{'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so',\n  'internal_api': 'mkl',\n  'num_threads': 2,\n  'prefix': 'libmkl_rt',\n  'threading_layer': 'intel',\n  'user_api': 'blas',\n  'version': '2019.0.4'},\n {'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so',\n  'internal_api': 'openmp',\n  'num_threads': 4,\n  'prefix': 'libiomp',\n  'user_api': 'openmp',\n  'version': None},\n {'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libgomp.so.1.0.0',\n  'internal_api': 'openmp',\n  'num_threads': 4,\n  'prefix': 'libgomp',\n  'user_api': 'openmp',\n  'version': None}]\n```\n\nIn the above example, `numpy` was installed from the default anaconda channel and comes\nwith MKL and its Intel OpenMP (`libiomp5`) implementation while `xgboost` was installed\nfrom pypi.org and links against GNU OpenMP (`libgomp`) so both OpenMP runtimes are\nloaded in the same Python program.\n\nThe state of these libraries is also accessible through the object oriented API:\n\n```python\n>>> from threadpoolctl import ThreadpoolController, threadpool_info\n>>> from pprint import pprint\n>>> import numpy\n>>> controller = ThreadpoolController()\n>>> pprint(controller.info())\n[{'architecture': 'Haswell',\n  'filepath': '/home/jeremie/miniconda/envs/dev/lib/libopenblasp-r0.3.17.so',\n  'internal_api': 'openblas',\n  'num_threads': 4,\n  'prefix': 'libopenblas',\n  'threading_layer': 'pthreads',\n  'user_api': 'blas',\n  'version': '0.3.17'}]\n\n>>> controller.info() == threadpool_info()\nTrue\n```\n\n### Setting the Maximum Size of Thread-Pools\n\nControl the number of threads used by the underlying runtime libraries\nin specific sections of your Python program:\n\n```python\n>>> from threadpoolctl import threadpool_limits\n>>> import numpy as np\n\n>>> with threadpool_limits(limits=1, user_api='blas'):\n...     # In this block, calls to blas implementation (like openblas or MKL)\n...     # will be limited to use only one thread. They can thus be used jointly\n...     # with thread-parallelism.\n...     a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)\n...     a_squared = a @ a\n```\n\nThe threadpools can also be controlled via the object oriented API, which is especially\nuseful to avoid searching through all the loaded shared libraries each time. It will\nhowever not act on libraries loaded after the instantiation of the\n`ThreadpoolController`:\n\n```python\n>>> from threadpoolctl import ThreadpoolController\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> controller = ThreadpoolController()\n\n>>> with controller.limit(limits=1, user_api='blas'):\n...     a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)\n...     a_squared = a @ a\n```\n\n### Restricting the limits to the scope of a function\n\n`threadpool_limits` and `ThreadpoolController` can also be used as decorators to set\nthe maximum number of threads used by the supported libraries at a function level. The\ndecorators are accessible through their `wrap` method:\n\n```python\n>>> from threadpoolctl import ThreadpoolController, threadpool_limits\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> controller = ThreadpoolController()\n\n>>> @controller.wrap(limits=1, user_api='blas')\n... # or @threadpool_limits.wrap(limits=1, user_api='blas')\n... def my_func():\n...     # Inside this function, calls to blas implementation (like openblas or MKL)\n...     # will be limited to use only one thread.\n...     a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)\n...     a_squared = a @ a\n...\n```\n\n### Switching the FlexiBLAS backend\n\n`FlexiBLAS` is a BLAS wrapper for which the BLAS backend can be switched at runtime.\n`threadpoolctl` exposes python bindings for this feature.

Then this\nnew controller class must be registered using the `threadpoolctl.register` function.\nAn complete example can be found [here](\n  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/tests/_pyMylib/__init__.py).\n\n### Sequential BLAS within OpenMP parallel region\n\nWhen one wants to have sequential BLAS calls within an OpenMP parallel region, it's\nsafer to set `limits=\"sequential_blas_under_openmp\"` since setting `limits=1` and\n`user_api=\"blas\"` might not lead to the expected behavior in some configurations\n(e.g. OpenBLAS with the OpenMP threading layer\nhttps://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2985).\n\n### Known Limitations\n\n- `threadpool_limits` can fail to limit the number of inner threads when nesting\n  parallel loops managed by distinct OpenMP runtime implementations (for instance\n  libgomp from GCC and libomp from clang/llvm or libiomp from ICC).\n\n  See the `test_openmp_nesting` function in [tests/test_threadpoolctl.py](\n  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/tests/test_threadpoolctl.py)\n  for an example. More information can be found at:\n  https://github.com/jeremiedbb/Nested_OpenMP\n\n  Note however that this problem does not happen when `threadpool_limits` is\n  used to limit the number of threads used internally by BLAS calls that are\n  themselves nested under OpenMP parallel loops. `threadpool_limits` works as\n  expected, even if the inner BLAS implementation relies on a distinct OpenMP\n  implementation.\n\n- Using Intel OpenMP (ICC) and LLVM OpenMP (clang) in the same Python program\n  under Linux is known to cause problems. See the following guide for more details\n  and workarounds:\n  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/multiple_openmp.md\n\n- Setting the maximum number of threads of the OpenMP and BLAS libraries has a global\n  effect and impacts the whole Python process. There is no thread level isolation as\n  these libraries do not offer thread-local APIs to configure the number of threads to\n  use in nested parallel calls.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\nTo make a release:\n\nBump the version number (`__version__`) in `threadpoolctl.py`.\n\nBuild the distribution archives:\n\n```bash\npip install flit\nflit build\n```\n\nCheck the contents of `dist/`.\n\nIf everything is fine, make a commit for the release, tag it, push the\ntag to github and then:\n\n```bash\nflit publish\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThe initial dynamic library introspection code was written by @anton-malakhov\nfor the smp package available at https://github.com/IntelPython/smp .\n\nthreadpoolctl extends this for other operating systems. Contrary to smp,\nthreadpoolctl does not attempt to limit the size of Python multiprocessing\npools (threads or processes) or set operating system-level CPU affinity\nconstraints: threadpoolctl only interacts with native libraries via their\npublic runtime APIs.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b1/2c/f504e55d98418f2fcf756a56877e6d9a45dd5ed28b3d7c267b300e85ad5b/threadpoolctl-3.3.0-py3-none-any.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2019, threadpoolctl contributors\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    * Neither the name of copyright holder nor the names of its contributors\n      may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n      without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

For example,\n  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous Python versions to use it too.\n- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\n`typing_extensions` is treated specially by static type checkers such as\nmypy and pyright. Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\n\n`typing_extensions` uses\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\nTherefore, it's safe to depend\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\n\n## Included items\n\nSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\ncomplete listing of module contents.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/16/3a/0d26ce356c7465a19c9ea8814b960f8a36c3b0d07c323176620b7b483e44/typing_extensions-4.10.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"1.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Much of the\nPython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.\nurllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python\nstandard libraries:\n\n- Thread safety.\n- Connection pooling.\n- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.\n- File uploads with multipart encoding.\n- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.\n- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.\n- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.\n- 100% test coverage.\n\nurllib3 is powerful and easy to use:\n\n```python3\n>>> import urllib3\n>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")\n>>> resp.status\n200\n>>> resp.data\nb\"User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install urllib3\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git\n$ cd urllib3\n$ pip install .\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nurllib3 has usage and reference documentation at [urllib3.readthedocs.io](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io).\n\n\n## Community\n\nurllib3 has a [community Discord channel](https://discord.gg/urllib3) for asking questions and\ncollaborating with other contributors. Drop by and say hello 👋\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nurllib3 happily accepts contributions. Please see our\n[contributing documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\nfor some tips on getting started.\n\n\n## Security Disclosures\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with maintainers.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@sethmlarson](https://github.com/sethmlarson) (Seth M.

Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2.

It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python\nstandard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 3.7+. It\nis also known to run on PyPy 3 (version 3.7 compatible python) on UNIX. It\nsupports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.\n\nFor more information, see the \"docs\" directory of the Waitress package or visit\nhttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/\n\n2.1.2\n-----\n\nBugfix\n~~~~~~\n\n- When expose_tracebacks is enabled waitress would fail to properly encode\n  unicode thereby causing another error during error handling. See\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/378\n\n- Header length checking had a calculation that was done incorrectly when the\n  data was received across multple socket reads. This calculation has been\n  corrected, and no longer will Waitress send back a 413 Request Entity Too\n  Large. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/376\n\nSecurity Bugfix\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- in 2.1.0 a new feature was introduced that allowed the WSGI thread to start\n  sending data to the socket. However this introduced a race condition whereby\n  a socket may be closed in the sending thread while the main thread is about\n  to call select() therey causing the entire application to be taken down.\n  Waitress will no longer close the socket in the WSGI thread, instead waking\n  up the main thread to cleanup. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377\n\n2.1.1\n-----\n\nSecurity Bugfix\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Waitress now validates that chunked encoding extensions are valid, and don't\n  contain invalid characters that are not allowed. They are still skipped/not\n  processed, but if they contain invalid data we no longer continue in and\n  return a 400 Bad Request. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request\n  smuggling. Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36\n\n- Waitress now validates that the chunk length is only valid hex digits when\n  parsing chunked encoding, and values such as ``0x01`` and ``+01`` are no\n  longer supported. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling.\n  Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36\n\n- Waitress now validates that the Content-Length sent by a remote contains only\n  digits in accordance with RFC7230 and will return a 400 Bad Request when the\n  Content-Length header contains invalid data, such as ``+10`` which would\n  previously get parsed as ``10`` and accepted. This stops potential HTTP\n  desync/HTTP request smuggling Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36\n\n2.1.0\n-----\n\nPython Version Support\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Python 3.6 is no longer supported by Waitress\n\n- Python 3.10 is fully supported by Waitress\n\nBugfix\n~~~~~~\n\n- ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` now sets the ``seekable``, ``seek``, and ``tell``\n  attributes from the underlying file if the underlying file is seekable. This\n  allows WSGI middleware to implement things like range requests for example\n\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/359 and\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/363\n\n- In Python 3 ``OSError`` is no longer subscriptable, this caused failures on\n  Windows attempting to loop to find an socket that would work for use in the\n  trigger.\n\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/361\n\n- Fixed an issue whereby ``BytesIO`` objects were not properly closed, and\n  thereby would not get cleaned up until garbage collection would get around to\n  it.\n\n  This led to potential for random memory spikes/memory issues, see\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/358 and\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/357 .\n\n  With thanks to Florian Schulze for testing/vaidating this fix!\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- When the WSGI app starts sending data to the output buffer, we now attempt to\n  send data directly to the socket. This avoids needing to wake up the main\n  thread to start sending data. Allowing faster transmission of the first byte.\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/364\n\n  With thanks to Michael Merickel for being a great rubber ducky!\n\n- Add REQUEST_URI to the WSGI environment.\n\n  REQUEST_URI is similar to ``request_uri`` in nginx. It is a string that\n  contains the request path before separating the query string and\n  decoding ``%``-escaped characters. \n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/72/83/c3de9799e2305898b02ea67bcd125ad06f271e2a82cc86fe66b7bf4e6f63/waitress-2.1.2.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Zope Public License (ZPL) Version 2.1\n\nA copyright notice accompanies this license document that identifies the\ncopyright holders.\n\nThis license has been certified as open source.

It began as\na simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has\nbecome one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and\n    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any\n    frame in the stack.\n-   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with\n    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n-   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle\n    streaming data.\n-   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs\n    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables\n    from URLs.\n-   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user\n    agents, cookies, files, and more.\n-   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications\n    locally.\n-   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without\n    requiring running a server.\n\nWerkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to\nchoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle\nrequests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications\nsuch as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.\n\n`Flask`_ wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while\nproviding more structure and patterns for defining powerful\napplications.\n\n.. _WSGI: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _Flask: https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -U Werkzeug\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response\n\n    @Request.application\n    def application(request):\n        return Response('Hello, World!')\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n        run_simple('localhost', 4000, application)\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Werkzeug and other\npopular packages.

We are\nseeking contributions to all of our roadmap items with the ``help wanted`` label. Please see the\n`Contributing`_ section for more information.\n\nCommunity\n---------\nFor help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. \"how do I do X?\") see the `docs <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_\nor `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow>`_.\n\nTo report a bug, file a documentation issue, or submit a feature request, please open a GitHub issue.\n\nFor release announcements and other discussions, please subscribe to our mailing list (mlflow-users@googlegroups.com)\nor join us on `Slack`_.\n\nRunning a Sample App With the Tracking API\n------------------------------------------\nThe programs in ``examples`` use the MLflow Tracking API. For instance, run::\n\n    python examples/quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py\n\nThis program will use `MLflow Tracking API <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_,\nwhich logs tracking data in ``./mlruns``. This can then be viewed with the Tracking UI.\n\n\nLaunching the Tracking UI\n-------------------------\nThe MLflow Tracking UI will show runs logged in ``./mlruns`` at `<http://localhost:5000>`_.\nStart it with::\n\n    mlflow ui\n\n**Note:** Running ``mlflow ui`` from within a clone of MLflow is not recommended - doing so will\nrun the dev UI from source. We recommend running the UI from a different working directory,\nspecifying a backend store via the ``--backend-store-uri`` option. Alternatively, see\ninstructions for running the dev UI in the `contributor guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.\n\n\nRunning a Project from a URI\n----------------------------\nThe ``mlflow run`` command lets you run a project packaged with a MLproject file from a local path\nor a Git URI::\n\n    mlflow run examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.4\n\n    mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=0.4\n\nSee ``examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine`` for a sample project with an MLproject file.\n\n\nSaving and Serving Models\n-------------------------\nTo illustrate managing models, the ``mlflow.sklearn`` package can log scikit-learn models as\nMLflow artifacts and then load them again for serving. There is an example training application in\n``examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py`` that you can run as follows::\n\n    $ python examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py\n    Score: 0.666\n    Model saved in run <run-id>\n\n    $ mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model\n\n    $ curl -d '{\"dataframe_split\": {\"columns\":[0],\"index\":[0,1],\"data\":[[1],[-1]]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  localhost:5000/invocations\n\n**Note:** If using MLflow skinny (``pip install mlflow-skinny``) for model serving, additional\nrequired dependencies (namely, ``flask``) will need to be installed for the MLflow server to function.\n\nOfficial MLflow Docker Image\n----------------------------\n\nThe official MLflow Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry at https://ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN\n    echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin\n    # Pull the latest version\n    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow\n    # Pull 2.2.1\n    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:v2.2.1\n\nContributing\n------------\nWe happily welcome contributions to MLflow. We are also seeking contributions to items on the\n`MLflow Roadmap <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/milestone/3>`_.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n   1. Definitions\n      a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n      b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n      c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n      d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n      e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n      f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n   2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n      c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n      d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n         ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n      f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n      b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n   d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\n   h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n   i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n   j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n   k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \"Licensor.\" The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.","FSFAP":"Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright notice and this notice are preserved.

The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\nThis license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike.

(`as is' distribution)\n   o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n      a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   \n   NO WARRANTY 9.\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","GPL-3.0-only":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.","GPL-3.0-or-later":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.","GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception":"﻿insert GPL v3 text here GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\nVersion 3.1, 31 March 2009\nGeneral information: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.","HPND":"Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer\n<copyright notice>\nPermission to use, copy, modify and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies , and that both that the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation , and that the name of <copyright holder> <or related entities> not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific, written prior permission . <copyright holder> makes no representations about the suitability of this software for any purpose.

It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\nby James Random Hacker.\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\nTy Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","LGPL-2.1-only":"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n< one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. >\nCopyright (C) < year > < name of author >\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\nby James Random Hacker.\n< signature of Ty Coon > , 1 April 1990\nTy Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","LGPL-2.1-or-later":"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n< one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. >\nCopyright (C) < year > < name of author >\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\nby James Random Hacker.\n< signature of Ty Coon > , 1 April 1990\nTy Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","LPPL-1.3a":"The LaTeX Project Public License\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nLPPL Version 1.3a 2004-10-01\nCopyright 1999 2002-04 LaTeX3 Project\nEveryone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed.\nPREAMBLE\n========\nThe LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.\nYou may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute. This license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated to TeX.\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\nDEFINITIONS\n===========\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n`Work' Any work being distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\n`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law. `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\n`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\n`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\n`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a \"LaTeX-Format\".\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n===========================================\n   1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\n   2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n   3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.\n   4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.\n   5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.\n   6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.\n      a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.\n      b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.\n      c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\n      d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\n         1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the modified component;\n         2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.\n   7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.\n   8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\n   9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.\n   10.\n      a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\n      b. If a Derived Work is distributed under this license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\n   11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.\n   12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\nNO WARRANTY\n===========\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\n=======================\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that is `author-maintained'.\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps:\n   1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search.\n   2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.\n      a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data within one month.\n      b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\n      3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\n      b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\n   4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\n   5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month.\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\n======================================================\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section.\nChoosing This License or Another License\n----------------------------------------\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL.\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it.\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components.\nHow to Use This License\n-----------------------\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license.\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n%% pig.dtx\n%% Copyright 2003 M. Y. Name\n%\n% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the\n% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n% of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n% The latest version of this license is in\n% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n% version 2003/12/01 or later.\n%\n% This work has the LPPL maintenance status \"maintained\".\n%\n% This Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n%\n% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins % and the derived file pig.sty.\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any \"LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change \"maintained\" above into \"author-maintained\". However, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\nImportant Recommendations\n-------------------------\nDefining What Constitutes the Work\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as:\n% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.","MIT":"The following files are derived from Stackless Python and are subject to the\nsame license as Stackless Python:\n\n\tsrc/greenlet/slp_platformselect.h\n\tfiles in src/greenlet/platform/ directory\n\nSee LICENSE.PSF and http://www.stackless.com/ for details.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the files in greenlet have been released under the\nfollowing MIT license:\n\nCopyright (c) Armin Rigo, Christian Tismer and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Distribution Obligations.\n      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n         (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n         (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Application of this License.\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n   6. Versions of the License.\n      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n         [1] A Developer specific license.\n         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n   8. TERMINATION.\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.

REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS\n\nThe Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.\n\nProper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:\n\n    Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).\n\nThe reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).\n\nCommercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is permitted.\n\nAny publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.\n\n\nII. COPYRIGHT\n\nThe copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee.\n\n\nIII. SCOPE OF LICENSE\n\nThe following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.\n\nMere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and appropriate copyright notice.\n\nSEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.\n\nNO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.\n\n\nIV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS\n\nAll modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements:\n\n   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.\n   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.\n   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.\n   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.\n   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's (or authors') permission. \n\n\nV. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\n\n   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\n   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\n   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s). \n\n\nVI. LICENSE OPTIONS\n\nThe author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.\n\nA. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the explicit permission of the author(s). \"Substantive modification\" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\nB. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\n\nOPEN PUBLICATION POLICY APPENDIX:\n\n(This is not considered part of the license.)\n\nOpen Publication works are available in source format via the Open Publication home page at http://works.opencontent.org/.\n\nOpen Publication authors who want to include their own license on Open Publication works may do so, as long as their terms are not more restrictive than the Open Publication license.\n\nIf you have questions about the Open Publication License, please contact David Wiley, and/or the Open Publication Authors' List at opal@opencontent.org, via email.\n\nTo subscribe to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"subscribe\" in the body.\n\nTo post to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal@opencontent.org or simply reply to a previous post.\n\nTo unsubscribe from the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"unsubscribe\" in the body.","public-domain":"No license text found","zsh":"Unless otherwise noted in the header of specific files, files in this\ndistribution have the licence shown below.\n\nHowever, note that certain shell functions are licensed under versions\nof the GNU General Public Licence.
