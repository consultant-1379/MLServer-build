It\nis authored by the Python core developers; I have simply merged the Python 2.7\nand the Python 3.5 source and test suites, and added a wrapper. This factoring\nout is to provide a library implementation that supports both versions.\n\nAdded to this is a pretty-printing ``dump`` utility function.\n\nThe test suite both runs specific tests and also roundtrips much of the\nstandard library.\n\nExtensions and Alternatives\n---------------------------\n\nSimilar projects include:\n\n    * codegen_\n    * astor_\n    * astmonkey_\n    * astprint_\n\nNone of these roundtrip much of the standard library and fail several of the basic\ntests in the ``test_unparse`` test suite.\n\nThis library uses mature and core maintained code instead of trying to patch\nexisting libraries. The ``unparse`` and the ``test_unparse`` modules\nare under the PSF license.\n\nExtensions include:\n\n    * typed-astunparse: extends astunparse to support type annotations.\n\n* Documentation: http://astunparse.rtfd.org.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* unparses Python AST.\n* pretty-prints AST.\n\n\n.. _codegen: https://github.com/andreif/codegen\n.. _astor: https://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor\n.. _astmonkey: https://github.com/konradhalas/astmonkey\n.. _astprint: https://github.com/Manticore/astprint\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nHere's the recent changes to AST Unparser.\n\n1.6.3 - 2019-12-22\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add full support for Python 3.8\n\n1.6.2 - 2019-01-19\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Add support for the Constant node in Python 3.8\n* Add tests to the sdist\n\n1.6.1 - 2018-10-03\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Fix the roundtripping of very complex f-strings.\n\n1.6.0 - 2018-09-30\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Python 3.7 compatibility\n\n1.5.0 - 2017-02-05\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Python 3.6 compatibility\n* bugfix: correct argparser option type\n\n1.4.0 - 2016-06-24\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Support for the ``async`` keyword\n* Support for unparsing \"Interactive\" and \"Expression\" nodes\n\n1.3.0 - 2016-01-17\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Python 3.5 compatibility\n\n1.2.0 - 2014-04-03\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Python 2.6 through 3.4 compatibility\n* A new function ``dump`` is added to return a pretty-printed version\n  of the AST. It's also available when running ``python -m astunparse``\n  as the ``--dump`` argument.\n\n1.1.0 - 2014-04-01\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* ``unparse`` will return the source code for an AST. It is pretty\n  feature-complete, and round-trips the stdlib, and is compatible with\n  Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.\n\n  Running ``python -m astunparse`` will print the round-tripped source\n  for any python files given as argument.\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/2b/03/13dde6512ad7b4557eb792fbcf0c653af6076b81e5941d36ec61f7ce6028/astunparse-1.6.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) <year> <owner>\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n   1.

Also it's much faster than ``asyncio.wait_for()``\nbecause ``timeout`` doesn't create a new task.\n\nThe ``timeout(delay, *, loop=None)`` call returns a context manager\nthat cancels a block on *timeout* expiring::\n\n   from async_timeout import timeout\n   async with timeout(1.5):\n       await inner()\n\n1. If ``inner()`` is executed faster than in ``1.5`` seconds nothing\n   happens.\n2. Otherwise ``inner()`` is cancelled internally by sending\n   ``asyncio.CancelledError`` into but ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` is\n   raised outside of context manager scope.\n\n*timeout* parameter could be ``None`` for skipping timeout functionality.\n\n\nAlternatively, ``timeout_at(when)`` can be used for scheduling\nat the absolute time::\n\n   loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n   now = loop.time()\n\n   async with timeout_at(now + 1.5):\n       await inner()\n\n\nPlease note: it is not POSIX time but a time with\nundefined starting base, e.g. the time of the system power on.\n\n\nContext manager has ``.expired`` property for check if timeout happens\nexactly in context manager::\n\n   async with timeout(1.5) as cm:\n       await inner()\n   print(cm.expired)\n\nThe property is ``True`` if ``inner()`` execution is cancelled by\ntimeout context manager.\n\nIf ``inner()`` call explicitly raises ``TimeoutError`` ``cm.expired``\nis ``False``.\n\nThe scheduled deadline time is available as ``.deadline`` property::\n\n   async with timeout(1.5) as cm:\n       cm.deadline\n\nNot finished yet timeout can be rescheduled by ``shift_by()``\nor ``shift_to()`` methods::\n\n   async with timeout(1.5) as cm:\n       cm.shift(1)  # add another second on waiting\n       cm.update(loop.time() + 5)  # reschedule to now+5 seconds\n\nRescheduling is forbidden if the timeout is expired or after exit from ``async with``\ncode block.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n   $ pip install async-timeout\n\nThe library is Python 3 only!\n\n\n\nAuthors and

**joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka [dunder methods](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dunder-methods)).\n[Trusted by

for Mars missions since 2020!\n\nIts main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\n*attrs* would not be possible without our [amazing sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\nEspecially those generously supporting us at the *The Organization* tier and higher:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n   <a

href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/hynek\">joining them</a> to help make <em>attrs</em>’s maintenance more sustainable!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<!-- teaser-end -->\n\n## Example\n\n*attrs* gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:\n\n<!-- code-begin -->\n\n```pycon\n>>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory\n\n>>> @define\n... class SomeClass:\n...     a_number: int = 42\n...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)\n...\n...     def hard_math(self, another_number):\n...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number\n\n\n>>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\n>>> sc\nSomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])\n\n>>> sc.hard_math(3)\n19\n>>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\nTrue\n>>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])\nTrue\n\n>>> asdict(sc)\n{'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}\n\n>>> SomeClass()\nSomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])\n\n>>> C = make_class(\"C\", [\"a\", \"b\"])\n>>> C(\"foo\", \"bar\")\nC(a='foo', b='bar')\n```\n\nAfter *declaring* your attributes, *attrs* gives you:\n\n- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,\n- a nice human-readable `__repr__`,\n- equality-checking methods,\n- an initializer,\n- and much more,\n\n*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.\n\n**Hate type annotations**!?\nNo problem!\nTypes are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.\nSimply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types.\n\n---\n\nThis example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.\nThe classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.\n\nPlease check out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for a more in-depth explanation.\n\n\n## Data Classes\n\nOn the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).\nIn practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.\nFor instance it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization), and allows for stepping through the generated methods using a debugger.\n\nFor more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes).\n\n\n## Project Information\n\n- [**Changelog**](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html)\n-

more.](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-attrs?utm_source=pypi-attrs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo)\n\n## Release Information\n\n### Changes\n\n- The type annotation for `attrs.resolve_types()` is now correct.\n  [#1141](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1141)\n- Type stubs now use `typing.dataclass_transform` to decorate dataclass-like decorators, instead of the non-standard `__dataclass_transform__` special form, which is only supported by Pyright.\n  [#1158](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1158)\n- Fixed serialization of namedtuple fields using `attrs.asdict/astuple()` with `retain_collection_types=True`.\n  [#1165](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1165)\n- `attrs.AttrsInstance` is now a `typing.Protocol` in both type hints and code.\n  This allows you to subclass it along with another `Protocol`.\n  [#1172](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1172)\n- If *attrs* detects that `__attrs_pre_init__` accepts more than just `self`, it will call it with the same arguments as `__init__` was called.\n  This allows you to, for example, pass arguments to `super().__init__()`.\n  [#1187](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1187)\n- Slotted classes now transform `functools.cached_property` decorated methods to support equivalent semantics.\n  [#1200](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1200)\n- Added *class_body* argument to `attrs.make_class()` to provide additional attributes for newly created classes.\n  It is, for example, now possible to attach methods.\n  [#1203](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1203)\n\n\n---\n\n[Full

Here are some numbers.\n\n| Package                                       | Accuracy | Mean per file (ms) | File per sec (est) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |   86 %   |       200 ms       |     5 file/sec     |\n| charset-normalizer                            | **98 %** |     **10 ms**      |    100 file/sec    |\n\n| Package                                       | 99th percentile | 95th percentile | 50th percentile |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |     1200 ms     |     287 ms      |      23 ms      |\n| charset-normalizer                            |     100 ms      |      50 ms      |      5 ms       |\n\nChardet's performance on larger file (1MB+) are very poor. Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

Disabling\n                        JSON output.\n  -r, --replace         Replace file when trying to normalize it instead of\n                        creating a new one.\n  -f, --force           Replace file without asking if you are sure, use this\n                        flag with caution.\n  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD\n                        Define a custom maximum amount of chaos allowed in\n                        decoded content. 0. <= chaos <= 1.\n  --version             Show version information and exit.\n```\n\n```bash\nnormalizer ./data/sample.1.fr.srt\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\npython -m charset_normalizer ./data/sample.1.fr.srt\n```\n\n🎉 Since version 1.4.0 the CLI produce easily usable stdout result in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"path\": \"/home/default/projects/charset_normalizer/data/sample.1.fr.srt\",\n    \"encoding\": \"cp1252\",\n    \"encoding_aliases\": [\n        \"1252\",\n        \"windows_1252\"\n    ],\n    \"alternative_encodings\": [\n        \"cp1254\",\n        \"cp1256\",\n        \"cp1258\",\n        \"iso8859_14\",\n        \"iso8859_15\",\n        \"iso8859_16\",\n        \"iso8859_3\",\n        \"iso8859_9\",\n        \"latin_1\",\n        \"mbcs\"\n    ],\n    \"language\": \"French\",\n    \"alphabets\": [\n        \"Basic Latin\",\n        \"Latin-1 Supplement\"\n    ],\n    \"has_sig_or_bom\": false,\n    \"chaos\": 0.149,\n    \"coherence\": 97.152,\n    \"unicode_path\": null,\n    \"is_preferred\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Python\n*Just print out normalized text*\n```python\nfrom charset_normalizer import from_path\n\nresults = from_path('./my_subtitle.srt')\n\nprint(str(results.best()))\n```\n\n*Upgrade your code without effort*\n```python\nfrom charset_normalizer import detect\n```\n\nThe above code will behave the same as **chardet**. We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can. \n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

Thank you!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTested on CPython 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 and Pypy 2.7 and 3.8.\n\nNo requirements other than the standard library.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install colorama\n    # or\n    conda install -c anaconda colorama\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal\ntext and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on\nWindows, too, by wrapping ``stdout``, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which\nwould appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the\nappropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,\nColorama does nothing.\n\nThis has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing\ncolored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing\napplications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on\nLinux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling\n``colorama.just_fix_windows_console()`` (since v0.4.6) or ``colorama.init()``\n(all versions, but may have other side-effects – see below).\n\nAn alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows machines, which\nprovides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals. Colorama\nis intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g., maybe your app doesn't\nhave an installer.)\n\nDemo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using\nANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's built in ANSI\nhandling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/ubuntu-demo.png\n    :width: 661\n    :height: 357\n    :alt: ANSI sequences on Ubuntu under gnome-terminal.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/windows-demo.png\n    :width: 668\n    :height: 325\n    :alt: Same ANSI sequences on Windows, using Colorama.\n\nThese screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support ANSI 'dim\ntext'; it looks the same as 'normal text'.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInitialisation\n..............\n\nIf the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work on\nWindows, then run:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\nIf you're on a recent version of Windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr\nare pointing to a Windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration\nswitch to enable Windows' built-in ANSI support.\n\nIf you're on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to\na Windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr`` in a\nmagic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues the\nappropriate Win32 calls to emulate them.\n\nIn all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. Basically the idea is\nthat this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to ANSI escape handling.\n\nIt's safe to call this function multiple times. It's safe to call this function\non non-Windows platforms, but it won't do anything. It's safe to call this\nfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file – it\nwon't do anything to those streams.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more\npotential footguns):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import init\n    init()\n\nThis does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for the\nfollowing differences:\n\n- It's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up with multiple\n  layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.\n\n- Colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,\n  and if it thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and\n  ``sys.stderr`` in a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences\n  before printing them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if\n  you want to write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and\n  let Colorama decide whether they should actually be output. But note that\n  Colorama's heuristic is not particularly clever.\n\n- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various\n  functionality – see below.\n\nTo stop using Colorama before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.\nThis will restore ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to their original values, so that\nColorama is disabled. To resume using Colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it is\ncheaper than calling ``init()`` again (but does the same thing).\n\nMost users should depend on ``colorama >= 0.4.6``, and use\n``just_fix_windows_console``. The old ``init`` interface will be supported\nindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to fix any issues\nwith it, also for backwards compatibility.\n\nColored Output\n..............\n\nCross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama's\nconstant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberately\nrudimentary, see below.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import Fore, Back, Style\n    print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\n    print(Back.GREEN + 'and with a green background')\n    print(Style.DIM + 'and in dim text')\n    print(Style.RESET_ALL)\n    print('back to normal now')\n\n...or simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    print('\\033[31m' + 'some red text')\n    print('\\033[39m') # and reset to default color\n\n...or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ANSI libraries\nsuch as the venerable `Termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_\nthe fabulous `Blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,\nor the incredible `_Rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.\n\nIf you wish Colorama's Fore, Back and Style constants were more capable,\nthen consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate\ncolors, etc, and use Colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert\nthose ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:\n\nSIMILARLY, do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.\nWe are only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, not\nshortcuts like the above to generate ANSI characters.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    from termcolor import colored\n\n    # use Colorama to make Termcolor work on Windows too\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\n    # then use Termcolor for all colored text output\n    print(colored('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red'))\n\nAvailable formatting constants are::\n\n    Fore: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\n    Back: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\n    Style: DIM, NORMAL, BRIGHT, RESET_ALL\n\n``Style.RESET_ALL`` resets foreground, background, and brightness. Colorama will\nperform this reset automatically on program exit.\n\nThese are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard::\n\n    Fore: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\n    Back: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\n\nCursor Positioning\n..................\n\nANSI codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See ``demos/demo06.py`` for\nan example of how to generate them.\n\nInit Keyword Args\n.................\n\n``init()`` accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.\n\ninit(autoreset=False):\n    If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color\n    changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=True)`` will\n    automate that:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from colorama import init\n        init(autoreset=True)\n        print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\n        print('automatically back to default color again')\n\ninit(strip=None):\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether ANSI codes should be\n    stripped from the output. The default behaviour is to strip if on Windows\n    or if output is redirected (not a tty).\n\ninit(convert=None):\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether to convert ANSI codes in the\n    output into win32 calls. The default behaviour is to convert if on Windows\n    and output is to a tty (terminal).\n\ninit(wrap=True):\n    On Windows, Colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``\n    with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their work.\n    If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing\n    ``init(wrap=False)``. The default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset`` or\n    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are True.\n\n    When wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-Windows platforms will\n    continue to work as normal. To do cross-platform colored output, you can\n    use Colorama's ``AnsiToWin32`` proxy directly:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        import sys\n        from colorama import init, AnsiToWin32\n        init(wrap=False)\n        stream = AnsiToWin32(sys.stderr).stream\n\n        # Python 2\n        print >>stream, Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr'\n\n        # Python 3\n        print(Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)\n\nRecognised ANSI Sequences\n.........................\n\nANSI sequences generally take the form::\n\n    ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>\n\nWhere ``<param>`` is an integer, and ``<command>`` is a single letter. Zero or\nmore params are passed to a ``<command>``. If no params are passed, it is\ngenerally synonymous with passing a single zero. No spaces exist in the\nsequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.\n\nThe only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls are::\n\n    ESC [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)\n    ESC [ 1 m       # bright\n    ESC [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)\n    ESC [ 22 m      # normal brightness\n\n    # FOREGROUND:\n    ESC [ 30 m      # black\n    ESC [ 31 m      # red\n    ESC [ 32 m      # green\n    ESC [ 33 m      # yellow\n    ESC [ 34 m      # blue\n    ESC [ 35 m      # magenta\n    ESC [ 36 m      # cyan\n    ESC [ 37 m      # white\n    ESC [ 39 m      # reset\n\n    # BACKGROUND\n    ESC [ 40 m      # black\n    ESC [ 41 m      # red\n    ESC [ 42 m      # green\n    ESC [ 43 m      # yellow\n    ESC [ 44 m      # blue\n    ESC [ 45 m      # magenta\n    ESC [ 46 m      # cyan\n    ESC [ 47 m      # white\n    ESC [ 49 m      # reset\n\n    # cursor positioning\n    ESC [ y;x H     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    ESC [ y;x f     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    ESC [ n A       # move cursor n lines up\n    ESC [ n B       # move cursor n lines down\n    ESC [ n C       # move cursor n characters forward\n    ESC [ n D       # move cursor n characters backward\n\n    # clear the screen\n    ESC [ mode J    # clear the screen\n\n    # clear the line\n    ESC [ mode K    # clear the line\n\nMultiple numeric params to the ``'m'`` command can be combined into a single\nsequence::\n\n    ESC [ 36 ; 45 ; 1 m     # bright cyan text on magenta background\n\nAll other ANSI sequences of the form ``ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>``\nare silently stripped from the output on Windows.\n\nAny other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative\ninitial characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to add\nthem though. Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues on\nGitHub.\n\nStatus & Known Problems\n-----------------------\n\nI've personally only tested it on Windows XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu\n(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.\n\nSome valid ANSI sequences aren't recognised.\n\nIf you're hacking on the code, see `README-hacking.md`_. ESPECIALLY, see the\nexplanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow Colorama to generate new\ntypes of ANSI codes.\n\nSee outstanding issues and wish-list:\nhttps://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues\n\nIf anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,\nI'd love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,\nand would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patch\nor two.\n\n.. _README-hacking.md: README-hacking.md\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright Jonathan Hartley & Arnon Yaari, 2013-2020.

The ColoredFormatter_ class inherits from `logging.Formatter`_ and uses\n`ANSI escape sequences`_ to render your logging messages in color. It uses only\nstandard colors so it should work on any UNIX terminal. It's currently tested\non Python 2.7, 3.5+ and PyPy (2 and 3). On Windows `coloredlogs` automatically\ntries to enable native ANSI support (on up-to-date Windows 10 installations)\nand falls back on using colorama_ (if installed). Here is a screen shot of the\ndemo that is printed when the command ``coloredlogs --demo`` is executed:\n\n.. image:: https://coloredlogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/defaults.png\n\nNote that the screenshot above includes custom logging levels defined by my\nverboselogs_ package: if you install both `coloredlogs` and `verboselogs` it\nwill Just Work (`verboselogs` is of course not required to use\n`coloredlogs`).\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe `coloredlogs` package is available on PyPI_ which means installation should\nbe as simple as:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ pip install coloredlogs\n\nThere's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per\nuser site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing\nsystem wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so\nif this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these\ninstructions 😉.\n\nOptional dependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNative ANSI support on Windows requires an up-to-date Windows 10 installation.\nIf this is not working for you then consider installing the colorama_ package:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ pip install colorama\n\nOnce colorama_ is installed it will be used automatically.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nHere's an example of how easy it is to get started:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   import coloredlogs, logging\n\n   # Create a logger object.\n   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n   # By default the install() function installs a handler on the root logger,\n   # this means that log messages from your code and log messages from the\n   # libraries that you use will all show up on the terminal.\n   coloredlogs.install(level='DEBUG')\n\n   # If you don't want to see log messages from libraries, you can pass a\n   # specific logger object to the install() function. In this case only log\n   # messages originating from that logger will show up on the terminal.\n   coloredlogs.install(level='DEBUG', logger=logger)\n\n   # Some examples.\n   logger.debug(\"this is a debugging message\")\n   logger.info(\"this is an informational message\")\n   logger.warning(\"this is a warning message\")\n   logger.error(\"this is an error message\")\n   logger.critical(\"this is a critical message\")\n\nFormat of log messages\n----------------------\n\nThe ColoredFormatter_ class supports user defined log formats so you can use\nany log format you like. The default log format is as follows::\n\n %(asctime)s %(hostname)s %(name)s[%(process)d] %(levelname)s %(message)s\n\nThis log format results in the following output::\n\n 2015-10-23 03:32:22 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] DEBUG message with level 'debug'\n 2015-10-23 03:32:23 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] VERBOSE message with level 'verbose'\n 2015-10-23 03:32:24 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] INFO message with level 'info'\n ...\n\nYou can customize the log format and styling using environment variables as\nwell as programmatically, please refer to the `online documentation`_ for\ndetails.\n\nEnabling millisecond precision\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you're switching from `logging.basicConfig()`_ to `coloredlogs.install()`_\nyou may notice that timestamps no longer include milliseconds. This is because\ncoloredlogs doesn't output milliseconds in timestamps unless you explicitly\ntell it to. There are three ways to do that:\n\n1. The easy way is to pass the `milliseconds` argument to `coloredlogs.install()`_::\n\n    coloredlogs.install(milliseconds=True)\n\n   This became supported in `release 7.1`_ (due to `#16`_).\n\n2. Alternatively you can change the log format `to include 'msecs'`_::\n\n    %(asctime)s,%(msecs)03d %(hostname)s %(name)s[%(process)d] %(levelname)s %(message)s\n\n   Here's what the call to `coloredlogs.install()`_ would then look like::\n\n    coloredlogs.install(fmt='%(asctime)s,%(msecs)03d %(hostname)s %(name)s[%(process)d] %(levelname)s %(message)s')\n\n   Customizing the log format also enables you to change the delimiter that\n   separates seconds from milliseconds (the comma above). This became possible\n   in `release 3.0`_ which added support for user defined log formats.\n\n3. If the use of ``%(msecs)d`` isn't flexible enough you can instead add ``%f``\n   to the date/time format, it will be replaced by the value of ``%(msecs)03d``.\n   Support for the ``%f`` directive was added to `release 9.3`_ (due to `#45`_).\n\nCustom logging fields\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following custom log format fields are supported:\n\n- ``%(hostname)s`` provides the hostname of the local system.\n- ``%(programname)s`` provides the name of the currently running program.\n- ``%(username)s`` provides the username of the currently logged in user.\n\nWhen `coloredlogs.install()`_ detects that any of these fields are used in the\nformat string the applicable logging.Filter_ subclasses are automatically\nregistered to populate the relevant log record fields.\n\nChanging text styles and colors\n-------------------------------\n\nThe online documentation contains `an example of customizing the text styles and\ncolors <https://coloredlogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#changing-the-colors-styles>`_.\n\nColored output from cron\n------------------------\n\nWhen `coloredlogs` is used in a cron_ job, the output that's e-mailed to you by\ncron won't contain any ANSI escape sequences because `coloredlogs` realizes\nthat it's not attached to an interactive terminal. If you'd like to have colors\ne-mailed to you by cron there are two ways to make it happen:\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nModifying your crontab\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere's an example of a minimal crontab::\n\n    MAILTO=\"your-email-address@here\"\n    CONTENT_TYPE=\"text/html\"\n    * * * * * root coloredlogs --to-html your-command\n\nThe ``coloredlogs`` program is installed when you install the `coloredlogs`\nPython package. When you execute ``coloredlogs --to-html your-command`` it runs\n``your-command`` under the external program ``script`` (you need to have this\ninstalled). This makes ``your-command`` think that it's attached to an\ninteractive terminal which means it will output ANSI escape sequences which\nwill then be converted to HTML by the ``coloredlogs`` program. Yes, this is a\nbit convoluted, but it works great :-)\n\nModifying your Python code\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ColoredCronMailer_ class provides a context manager that automatically\nenables HTML output when the ``$CONTENT_TYPE`` variable has been correctly set\nin the crontab.\n\nThis requires my capturer_ package which you can install using ``pip install\n'coloredlogs[cron]'``. The ``[cron]`` extra will pull in capturer_ 2.4 or newer\nwhich is required to capture the output while silencing it - otherwise you'd\nget duplicate output in the emails sent by ``cron``.\n\nThe context manager can also be used to retroactively silence output that has\nalready been produced, this can be useful to avoid spammy cron jobs that have\nnothing useful to do but still email their output to the system administrator\nevery few minutes :-).\n\nContact\n-------\n\nThe latest version of `coloredlogs` is available on PyPI_ and GitHub_.

With a simple command like `squad_dataset = load_dataset(\"squad\")`, get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX),\n- **efficient data pre-processing**: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV, JSON, text, PNG, JPEG, WAV, MP3, Parquet, etc. With simple commands like `processed_dataset = dataset.map(process_example)`, efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.\n\n[🎓 **Documentation**](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/) [🔎 **Find a dataset in the Hub**](https://huggingface.co/datasets) [🌟 **Share a dataset on the Hub**](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share)\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://hf.co/course\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/datasets/main/docs/source/imgs/course_banner.png\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n🤗 Datasets is designed to let the community easily add and share new datasets.\n\n🤗 Datasets has many additional interesting features:\n\n- Thrive on large datasets: 🤗 Datasets naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped using an efficient zero-serialization cost backend (Apache Arrow).\n- Smart caching: never wait for your data to process several times.\n- Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API (multi-processing/caching/memory-mapping).\n- Built-in interoperability with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow 2 and JAX.\n- Native support for audio and image data.\n- Enable streaming mode to save disk space and start iterating over the dataset immediately.\n\n🤗 Datasets originated from a fork of the awesome [TensorFlow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) and the HuggingFace team want to deeply thank the TensorFlow Datasets team for building this amazing library. More details on the differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds` can be found in the section [Main differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds`](#main-differences-between--datasets-and-tfds).\n\n# Installation\n\n## With pip\n\n🤗 Datasets can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)\n\n```bash\npip install datasets\n```\n\n## With conda\n\n🤗 Datasets can be installed using conda as follows:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets\n```\n\nFollow the installation pages of TensorFlow and PyTorch to see how to install them with conda.\n\nFor more details on installation, check the installation page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation\n\n## Installation to use with PyTorch/TensorFlow/pandas\n\nIf you plan to use 🤗 Datasets with PyTorch (1.0+), TensorFlow (2.2+) or pandas, you should also install PyTorch, TensorFlow or pandas.\n\nFor more details on using the library with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch or TensorFlow, check the quick start page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart\n\n# Usage\n\n🤗 Datasets is made to be very simple to use - the API is centered around a single function, `datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, **kwargs)`, that instantiates a dataset.\n\nThis library can be used for text/image/audio/etc. datasets. Here is an example to load a text dataset:\n\nHere is a quick example:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Print all the available datasets\nfrom huggingface_hub import list_datasets\nprint([dataset.id for dataset in list_datasets()])\n\n# Load a dataset and print the first example in the training set\nsquad_dataset = load_dataset('squad')\nprint(squad_dataset['train'][0])\n\n# Process the dataset - add a column with the length of the context texts\ndataset_with_length = squad_dataset.map(lambda x: {\"length\": len(x[\"context\"])})\n\n# Process the dataset - tokenize the context texts (using a tokenizer from the 🤗 Transformers library)\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')\n\ntokenized_dataset = squad_dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x['context']), batched=True)\n```\n\nIf your dataset is bigger than your disk or if you don't want to wait to download the data, you can use streaming:\n\n```python\n# If you want to use the dataset immediately and efficiently stream the data as you iterate over the dataset\nimage_dataset = load_dataset('cifar100', streaming=True)\nfor example in image_dataset[\"train\"]:\n    break\n```\n\nFor more details on using the library, check the quick start page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart and the specific pages on:\n\n- Loading a dataset: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading\n- What's in a Dataset: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/access\n- Processing data with 🤗 Datasets: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process\n    - Processing audio data: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/audio_process\n    - Processing image data: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/image_process\n    - Processing text data: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/nlp_process\n- Streaming a dataset: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream\n- Writing your own dataset loading script: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_script\n- etc.\n\n# Add a new dataset to the Hub\n\nWe have a very detailed step-by-step guide to add a new dataset to the ![number of datasets](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/datasets&color=brightgreen) datasets already provided on the [HuggingFace Datasets Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n\nYou can find:\n- [how to upload a dataset to the Hub using your web browser or Python](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/upload_dataset) and also\n- [how to upload it using Git](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share).\n\n# Main differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds`\n\nIf you are familiar with the great TensorFlow Datasets, here are the main differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds`:\n\n- the scripts in 🤗 Datasets are not provided within the library but are queried, downloaded/cached and dynamically loaded upon request\n- the backend serialization of 🤗 Datasets is based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) instead of TF Records and leverage python dataclasses for info and features with some diverging features (we mostly don't do encoding and store the raw data as much as possible in the backend serialization cache).\n- the user-facing dataset object of 🤗 Datasets is not a `tf.data.Dataset` but a built-in framework-agnostic dataset class with methods inspired by what we like in `tf.data` (like a `map()` method). It basically wraps a memory-mapped Arrow table cache.\n\n# Disclaimers\n\n🤗 Datasets may run Python code defined by the dataset authors to parse certain data formats or structures. For security reasons, we ask users to:\n- check the dataset scripts they're going to run beforehand and\n- pin the `revision` of the repositories they use.\n\nIf you're a dataset owner and wish to update any part of it (description, citation, license, etc.), or do not want your dataset to be included in the Hugging Face Hub, please get in touch by opening a discussion or a pull request in the Community tab of the dataset page.

Serialization\nis the process of converting an object to a byte stream, and the inverse\nof which is converting a byte stream back to a Python object hierarchy.\n\n``dill`` provides the user the same interface as the ``pickle`` module, and\nalso includes some additional features. In addition to pickling Python\nobjects, ``dill`` provides the ability to save the state of an interpreter\nsession in a single command.  Hence, it would be feasible to save an\ninterpreter session, close the interpreter, ship the pickled file to\nanother computer, open a new interpreter, unpickle the session and\nthus continue from the 'saved' state of the original interpreter\nsession.\n\n``dill`` can be used to store Python objects to a file, but the primary\nusage is to send Python objects across the network as a byte stream.\n``dill`` is quite flexible, and allows arbitrary user defined classes\nand functions to be serialized.  Thus ``dill`` is not intended to be\nsecure against erroneously or maliciously constructed data. It is\nleft to the user to decide whether the data they unpickle is from\na trustworthy source.\n\n``dill`` is part of ``pathos``, a Python framework for heterogeneous computing.\n``dill`` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,\nor suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of issues is located at\nhttps://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues, with a legacy list maintained at\nhttps://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos/query.\n\n\nMajor Features\n==============\n\n``dill`` can pickle the following standard types:\n\n    - none, type, bool, int, float, complex, bytes, str,\n    - tuple, list, dict, file, buffer, builtin,\n    - Python classes, namedtuples, dataclasses, metaclasses,\n    - instances of classes,\n    - set, frozenset, array, functions, exceptions\n\n``dill`` can also pickle more 'exotic' standard types:\n\n    - functions with yields, nested functions, lambdas,\n    - cell, method, unboundmethod, module, code, methodwrapper,\n    - methoddescriptor, getsetdescriptor, memberdescriptor, wrapperdescriptor,\n    - dictproxy, slice, notimplemented, ellipsis, quit\n\n``dill`` cannot yet pickle these standard types:\n\n    - frame, generator, traceback\n\n``dill`` also provides the capability to:\n\n    - save and load Python interpreter sessions\n    - save and extract the source code from functions and classes\n    - interactively diagnose pickling errors\n\n\nCurrent Release\n===============\n\nThe latest released version of ``dill`` is available from:\n\n    https://pypi.org/project/dill\n\n``dill`` is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.\n\n\nDevelopment Version\n===================\n\nYou can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at:\n\n    https://github.com/uqfoundation\n\nIf you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``dill`` can be installed with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install dill\n\nTo optionally include the ``objgraph`` diagnostic tool in the install::\n\n    $ pip install dill[graph]\n\nTo optionally include the ``gprof2dot`` diagnostic tool in the install::\n\n    $ pip install dill[profile]\n\nFor windows users, to optionally install session history tools::\n\n    $ pip install dill[readline]\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n``dill`` requires:\n\n    - ``python`` (or ``pypy``), **>=3.8**\n    - ``setuptools``, **>=42**\n\nOptional requirements:\n\n    - ``objgraph``, **>=1.7.2**\n    - ``gprof2dot``, **>=2022.7.29**\n    - ``pyreadline``, **>=1.7.1** (on windows)\n\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\n``dill`` is a drop-in replacement for ``pickle``. Existing code can be\nupdated to allow complete pickling using::\n\n    >>> import dill as pickle\n\nor::\n\n    >>> from dill import dumps, loads\n\n``dumps`` converts the object to a unique byte string, and ``loads`` performs\nthe inverse operation::\n\n    >>> squared = lambda x: x**2\n    >>> loads(dumps(squared))(3)\n    9\n\nThere are a number of options to control serialization which are provided\nas keyword arguments to several ``dill`` functions:\n\n* with *protocol*, the pickle protocol level can be set. This uses the\n  same value as the ``pickle`` module, *DEFAULT_PROTOCOL*.\n* with *byref=True*, ``dill`` to behave a lot more like pickle with\n  certain objects (like modules) pickled by reference as opposed to\n  attempting to pickle the object itself.\n* with *recurse=True*, objects referred to in the global dictionary are\n  recursively traced and pickled, instead of the default behavior of\n  attempting to store the entire global dictionary.\n* with *fmode*, the contents of the file can be pickled along with the file\n  handle, which is useful if the object is being sent over the wire to a\n  remote system which does not have the original file on disk. Options are\n  *HANDLE_FMODE* for just the handle, *CONTENTS_FMODE* for the file content\n  and *FILE_FMODE* for content and handle.\n* with *ignore=False*, objects reconstructed with types defined in the\n  top-level script environment use the existing type in the environment\n  rather than a possibly different reconstructed type.\n\nThe default serialization can also be set globally in *dill.settings*.\nThus, we can modify how ``dill`` handles references to the global dictionary\nlocally or globally::\n\n    >>> import dill.settings\n    >>> dumps(absolute) == dumps(absolute, recurse=True)\n    False\n    >>> dill.settings['recurse'] = True\n    >>> dumps(absolute) == dumps(absolute, recurse=True)\n    True\n\n``dill`` also includes source code inspection, as an alternate to pickling::\n\n    >>> import dill.source\n    >>> print(dill.source.getsource(squared))\n    squared = lambda x:x**2\n\nTo aid in debugging pickling issues, use *dill.detect* which provides\ntools like pickle tracing::\n\n    >>> import dill.detect\n    >>> with dill.detect.trace():\n    >>>     dumps(squared)\n    ┬ F1: <function <lambda> at 0x7fe074f8c280>\n    ├┬ F2: <function _create_function at 0x7fe074c49c10>\n    │└ # F2 [34 B]\n    ├┬ Co: <code object <lambda> at 0x7fe07501eb30, file \"<stdin>\", line 1>\n    │├┬ F2: <function _create_code at 0x7fe074c49ca0>\n    ││└ # F2 [19 B]\n    │└ # Co [87 B]\n    ├┬ D1: <dict object at 0x7fe0750d4680>\n    │└ # D1 [22 B]\n    ├┬ D2: <dict object at 0x7fe074c5a1c0>\n    │└ # D2 [2 B]\n    ├┬ D2: <dict object at 0x7fe074f903c0>\n    │├┬ D2: <dict object at 0x7fe074f8ebc0>\n    ││└ # D2 [2 B]\n    │└ # D2 [23 B]\n    └ # F1 [180 B]\n\nWith trace, we see how ``dill`` stored the lambda (``F1``) by first storing\n``_create_function``, the underlying code object (``Co``) and ``_create_code``\n(which is used to handle code objects), then we handle the reference to\nthe global dict (``D2``) plus other dictionaries (``D1`` and ``D2``) that\nsave the lambda object's state. A ``#`` marks when the object is actually stored.\n\n\nMore Information\n================\n\nProbably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at\nhttp://dill.rtfd.io. Also see ``dill.tests`` for a set of scripts that\ndemonstrate how ``dill`` can serialize different Python objects. You can\nrun the test suite with ``python -m dill.tests``. The contents of any\npickle file can be examined with ``undill``.  As ``dill`` conforms to\nthe ``pickle`` interface, the examples and documentation found at\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html also apply to ``dill``\nif one will ``import dill as pickle``. The source code is also generally\nwell documented, so further questions may be resolved by inspecting the\ncode itself. Please feel free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a\nquestion on stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**).\nIf you would like to share how you use ``dill`` in your work, please send\nan email (to **mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org**).\n\n\nCitation\n========\n\nIf you use ``dill`` to do research that leads to publication, we ask that you\nacknowledge use of ``dill`` by citing the following in your publication::\n\n    M.M.

With a simple command like `accuracy = load(\"accuracy\")`, get any of these metrics ready to use for evaluating a ML model in any framework (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX).\n- **comparisons and measurements**: comparisons are used to measure the difference between models and measurements are tools to evaluate datasets.\n- **an easy way of adding new evaluation modules to the 🤗 Hub**: you can create new evaluation modules and push them to a dedicated Space in the 🤗 Hub with `evaluate-cli create [metric name]`, which allows you to see easily compare different metrics and their outputs for the same sets of references and predictions.\n\n[🎓 **Documentation**](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/)\n\n🔎 **Find a [metric](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-metric), [comparison](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-comparison), [measurement](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-measurement) on the Hub**\n\n[🌟 **Add a new evaluation module**](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/)\n\n🤗 Evaluate also has lots of useful features like:\n\n- **Type checking**: the input types are checked to make sure that you are using the right input formats for each metric\n- **Metric cards**: each metrics comes with a card that describes the values, limitations and their ranges, as well as providing examples of their usage and usefulness.\n- **Community metrics:** Metrics live on the Hugging Face Hub and you can easily add your own metrics for your project or to collaborate with others.\n\n\n# Installation\n\n## With pip\n\n🤗 Evaluate can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)\n\n```bash\npip install evaluate\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n🤗 Evaluate's main methods are:\n\n- `evaluate.list_evaluation_modules()` to list the available metrics, comparisons and measurements\n- `evaluate.load(module_name, **kwargs)` to instantiate an evaluation module\n- `results = module.compute(*kwargs)` to compute the result of an evaluation module\n\n# Adding a new evaluation module\n\nFirst install the necessary dependencies to create a new metric with the following command:\n```bash\npip install evaluate[template]\n```\nThen you can get started with the following command which will create a new folder for your metric and display the necessary steps:\n```bash\nevaluate-cli create \"Awesome Metric\"\n```\nSee this [step-by-step guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/creating_and_sharing) in the documentation for detailed instructions.\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to [@marella](https://github.com/marella) for letting us use the `evaluate` namespace on PyPi previously used by his [library](https://github.com/marella/evaluate).\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/55/198d8bef9179e9f4f8ed34580cec0706abe1a3c98659bce551734eff6b8f/evaluate-0.4.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

To do so, create a *FileLock* first:\n\n```Python\nfrom filelock import Timeout, FileLock\n\nfile_path = \"high_ground.txt\"\nlock_path = \"high_ground.txt.lock\"\n\nlock = FileLock(lock_path, timeout=1)\n```\n\nThe lock object supports multiple ways for acquiring the lock, including the\nones used to acquire standard Python thread locks:\n\n```Python\nwith lock:\n    open(file_path, \"a\").write(\"Hello there!\")\n\nlock.acquire()\ntry:\n    open(file_path, \"a\").write(\"General Kenobi!\")\nfinally:\n    lock.release()\n```\n\nThe *acquire()* method accepts also a *timeout* parameter. If the lock cannot be\nacquired within *timeout* seconds, a *Timeout* exception is raised:\n\n```Python\ntry:\n    with lock.acquire(timeout=10):\n        open(file_path, \"a\").write(\"I have a bad feeling about this.\")\nexcept Timeout:\n    print(\"Another instance of this application currently holds the lock.\")\n```\n\nThe lock objects are recursive locks, which means that once acquired, they will\nnot block on successive lock requests:\n\n```Python\ndef cite1():\n    with lock:\n        open(file_path, \"a\").write(\"I hate it when he does that.\")\n\ndef cite2():\n    with lock:\n        open(file_path, \"a\").write(\"You don't want to sell me death sticks.\")\n\n# The lock is acquired here.\nwith lock:\n    cite1()\n    cite2()\n\n# And released here.\n```\n\n\n## FileLock vs SoftFileLock\n\nThe *FileLock* is platform dependent while the *SoftFileLock* is not. Use the\n*FileLock* if all instances of your application are running on the same host and\na *SoftFileLock* otherwise.\n\nThe *SoftFileLock* only watches the existence of the lock file. This makes it\nultra portable, but also more prone to dead locks if the application crashes.\nYou can simply delete the lock file in such cases.\n\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions are always welcome, please make sure they pass all tests before\ncreating a pull request. Never hesitate to open a new issue, although it may\ntake some time for me to respond.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis package is [public domain](./LICENSE.rst).\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/70/70/41905c80dcfe71b22fb06827b8eae65781783d4a14194bce79d16a013263/filelock-3.13.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the software to the public domain.

If this flag is not set, a C-extension will be built\n  and included into the distribution.\n\n  Here is how this can be done with ``pip``:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python3 -m pip install . --config-settings=pure-python=\n\n  This will also work with ``-e | --editable``.\n\n  The same can be achieved via ``pypa/build``:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python3 -m build --config-setting=pure-python=\n\n  Adding ``-w | --wheel`` can force ``pypa/build`` produce a wheel from source\n  directly, as opposed to building an ``sdist`` and then building from it.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  `#560 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/560>`__.\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds using the\n  ``with-cython-tracing`` `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting\n  -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  This can be used in CI and development environment to measure coverage\n  on Cython modules, but is not normally useful to the end-users or\n  downstream packagers.\n\n  Here's a usage example:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python3 -Im pip install . --config-settings=with-cython-tracing=true\n\n  For editable installs, this setting is on by default. Otherwise, it's\n  off unless requested explicitly.\n\n  The following produces C-files required for the Cython coverage\n  plugin to map the measurements back to the PYX-files:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python -Im pip install -e .\n\n  Alternatively, the ``FROZENLIST_CYTHON_TRACING=1`` environment variable\n  can be set to do the same as the `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  `#560 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/560>`__.\n\n- Coverage collection has been implemented for the Cython modules\n  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  It will also be reported to Codecov from any non-release CI jobs.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  `#561 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/561>`__.\n\n- A step-by-step ``Release Guide`` guide has\n  been added, describing how to release *frozenlist* -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  This is primarily targeting the maintainers.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  `#563 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/563>`__.\n\n- Detailed ``Contributing Guidelines`` on\n  authoring the changelog fragments have been published in the\n  documentation -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  `#564 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/564>`__.\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.4.0 (2023-07-12)\n==================\n\nThe published source distribution package became buildable\nunder Python 3.12.\n\n\n----\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Removed an unused ``typing.Tuple`` import\n  `#411 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/411>`_\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Dropped Python 3.7 support.\n  `#413 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/413>`_\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- `#410 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/410>`_, `#433 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/433>`_\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.3.3 (2022-11-08)\n==================\n\n- Fixed CI runs when creating a new release, where new towncrier versions\n  fail when the current version section is already present.\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.3.2 (2022-11-08)\n==================\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- Updated the CI runs to better check for test results and to avoid deprecated syntax. `#327 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/327>`_\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.3.1 (2022-08-02)\n==================\n\nThe published source distribution package became buildable\nunder Python 3.11.\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.3.0 (2022-01-18)\n==================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Do not install C sources with binary distributions.\n  `#250 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/250>`_\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Dropped Python 3.6 support\n  `#274 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/274>`_\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.2.0 (2021-10-16)\n==================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- ``FrozenList`` now supports being used as a generic type as per PEP 585, e.g. ``frozen_int_list: FrozenList[int]`` (requires Python 3.9 or newer).\n  `#172 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/172>`_\n- Added support for Python 3.10.\n  `#227 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/227>`_\n- Started shipping platform-specific wheels with the ``musl`` tag targeting typical Alpine Linux runtimes.\n  `#227 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/227>`_\n- Started shipping platform-specific arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon.\n  `#227 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/227>`_\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.1.1 (2020-11-14)\n==================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Provide x86 Windows wheels.\n  `#169 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/169>`_\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.1.0 (2020-10-13)\n==================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add support for hashing of a frozen list.\n  `#136 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/136>`_\n\n- Support Python 3.8 and 3.9.\n\n- Provide wheels for ``aarch64``, ``i686``, ``ppc64le``, ``s390x`` architectures on\n  Linux as well as ``x86_64``.\n\n\n----\n\n\n1.0.0 (2019-11-09)\n==================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.5; only 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 are supported going forward.\n  `#24 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/24>`_\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/cf/3d/2102257e7acad73efc4a0c306ad3953f68c504c16982bbdfee3ad75d8085/frozenlist-1.4.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Various optionally supported features might require specification of custom\nextra require, e.g. `pip install fsspec[ssh]` will install dependencies for `ssh` backends support.\nUse `pip install fsspec[full]` for installation of all known extra dependencies.\n\nUp-to-date package also provided through conda-forge distribution:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge fsspec\n```\n\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo produce a template or specification for a file-system interface, that specific implementations should follow,\nso that applications making use of them can rely on a common behaviour and not have to worry about the specific\ninternal implementation decisions with any given backend. Many such implementations are included in this package,\nor in sister projects such as `s3fs` and `gcsfs`.\n\nIn addition, if this is well-designed, then additional functionality, such as a key-value store or FUSE\nmounting of the file-system implementation may be available for all implementations \"for free\".\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease refer to [RTD](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n## Develop\n\nfsspec uses GitHub Actions for CI. Environment files can be found\nin the \"ci/\" directory. Note that the main environment is called \"py38\",\nbut it is expected that the version of python installed be adjustable at\nCI runtime. For local use, pick a version suitable for you.\n\n### Testing\n\nTests can be run in the dev environment, if activated, via ``pytest fsspec``.\n\nThe full fsspec suite requires a system-level docker, docker-compose, and fuse\ninstallation. If only making changes to one backend implementation, it is\nnot generally necessary to run all tests locally.\n\nIt is expected that contributors ensure that any change to fsspec does not\ncause issues or regressions for either other fsspec-related packages such\nas gcsfs and s3fs, nor for downstream users of fsspec. The \"downstream\" CI\nrun and corresponding environment file run a set of tests from the dask\ntest suite, and very minimal tests against pandas and zarr from the\ntest_downstream.py module in this repo.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nfsspec uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable) to ensure\na consistent code format throughout the project.\nRun ``black fsspec`` from the root of the filesystem_spec repository to\nauto-format your code. Additionally, many editors have plugins that will apply\n``black`` as you edit files. ``black`` is included in the ``tox`` environments.\n\nOptionally, you may wish to setup [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) to\nautomatically run ``black`` when you make a git commit.\nRun ``pre-commit install --install-hooks`` from the root of the\nfilesystem_spec repository to setup pre-commit hooks. ``black`` will now be run\nbefore you commit, reformatting any changed files. You can format without\ncommitting via ``pre-commit run`` or skip these checks with ``git commit\n--no-verify``.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/28/d3/c2e0403c735548abf991bba3f45ba39194dff4569f76a99fbe77078ba7c5/fsspec-2024.2.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"BSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018, Martin Durant\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2016 Google Inc. .

The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 35K models, 4K datasets, and 2K demos in which people can easily collaborate in their ML workflows. The Hub works as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and experiment with open-source Machine Learning.\n\nWith `huggingface_hub`, you can easily download and upload models, datasets, and Spaces. You can extract useful information from the Hub, and do much more. Some example use cases:\n* Downloading and caching files from a Hub repository.\n* Creating repositories and uploading an updated model every few epochs.\n* Extract metadata from all models that match certain criteria (e.g. models for `text-classification`).\n* List all files from a specific repository.\n\nRead all about it in [the library documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub).\n\n<br>\n\n## Integrating to the Hub.\n\nWe're partnering with cool open source ML libraries to provide free model hosting and versioning. You can find the existing integrations [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/libraries).\n\nThe advantages are:\n\n- Free model or dataset hosting for libraries and their users.\n- Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach.\n- Hosted inference API for all models publicly available.\n- In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models.\n- Anyone can upload a new model for your library, they just need to add the corresponding tag for the model to be discoverable.\n- Fast downloads! We use Cloudfront (a CDN) to geo-replicate downloads so they're blazing fast from anywhere on the globe.\n- Usage stats and more features to come.\n\nIf you would like to integrate your library, feel free to open an issue to begin the discussion. We wrote a [step-by-step guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-library) with ❤️ showing how to do this integration.\n\n<br>\n\n## Feedback (feature requests, bugs, etc.) is super welcome 💙💚💛💜♥️🧡\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/47/8f/cf6683de320cf3873850ba48b7383db96958fe435b8e227db92119f6d867/huggingface_hub-0.21.3-py3-none-any.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Some example features:\n\n- Parsing and formatting numbers, file sizes, pathnames and timespans in\n  simple, human friendly formats.\n\n- Easy to use timers for long running operations, with human friendly\n  formatting of the resulting timespans.\n\n- Prompting the user to select a choice from a list of options by typing the\n  option's number or a unique substring of the option.\n\n- Terminal interaction including text styling (ANSI escape sequences), user\n  friendly rendering of usage messages and querying the terminal for its\n  size.\n\nThe `humanfriendly` package is currently tested on Python 2.7, 3.5+ and PyPy\n(2.7) on Linux and macOS. While the intention is to support Windows as well,\nyou may encounter some rough edges.\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nIt's very simple to start using the `humanfriendly` package::\n\n   >>> import humanfriendly\n   >>> user_input = raw_input(\"Enter a readable file size: \")\n   Enter a readable file size: 16G\n   >>> num_bytes = humanfriendly.parse_size(user_input)\n   >>> print num_bytes\n   16000000000\n   >>> print \"You entered:\", humanfriendly.format_size(num_bytes)\n   You entered: 16 GB\n   >>> print \"You entered:\", humanfriendly.format_size(num_bytes, binary=True)\n   You entered: 14.9 GiB\n\nCommand line\n------------\n\n..

[[[end]]]\n\nA note about size units\n-----------------------\n\nWhen I originally published the `humanfriendly` package I went with binary\nmultiples of bytes (powers of two). It was pointed out several times that this\nwas a poor choice (see issue `#4`_ and pull requests `#8`_ and `#9`_) and thus\nthe new default became decimal multiples of bytes (powers of ten):\n\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n| Unit | Binary value  | Decimal value |\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n| KB   |          1024 |          1000 +\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n| MB   |       1048576 |       1000000 |\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n| GB   |    1073741824 |    1000000000 |\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n| TB   | 1099511627776 | 1000000000000 |\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n| etc  |               |               |\n+------+---------------+---------------+\n\nThe option to use binary multiples of bytes remains by passing the keyword\nargument `binary=True` to the `format_size()`_ and `parse_size()`_ functions.\n\nWindows support\n---------------\n\nWindows 10 gained native support for ANSI escape sequences which means commands\nlike ``humanfriendly --demo`` should work out of the box (if your system is\nup-to-date enough). If this doesn't work then you can install the colorama_\npackage, it will be used automatically once installed.\n\nContact\n-------\n\nThe latest version of `humanfriendly` is available on PyPI_ and GitHub_.

This is the latest version of\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna2008'))\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna2008'))\n    домен.испытание\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping that was developed by the\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementers should use transitional processing with caution, only in\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\nresults.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\nmodule name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\n\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\n  While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable\n  issues being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your\n  requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bf/3f/ea4b9117521a1e9c50344b909be7886dd00a519552724809bb1f486986c2/idna-3.6.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"BSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2023, Kim Davies and contributors.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n1.

[Benchmark here](https://keras.io/getting_started/benchmarks/).\n- **Datacenter-scale training**: Scale confidently from your laptop to large clusters of GPUs or TPUs.\n\nJoin nearly three million developers, from burgeoning startups to global enterprises, in harnessing the power of Keras 3.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install with pip\n\nKeras 3 is available on PyPI as `keras`. Note that Keras 2 remains available as the `tf-keras` package.\n\n1. Install `keras`:\n\n```\npip install keras --upgrade\n```\n\n2. Install backend package(s).\n\nTo use `keras`, you should also install the backend of choice: `tensorflow`, `jax`, or `torch`.\nNote that `tensorflow` is required for using certain Keras 3 features: certain preprocessing layers\nas well as `tf.data` pipelines.\n\n### Local installation\n\n#### Minimal installation\n\nKeras 3 is compatible with Linux and MacOS systems. For Windows users, we recommend using WSL2 to run Keras.\nTo install a local development version:\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n2. Run installation command from the root directory.\n\n```\npython pip_build.py --install\n```\n\n3. Run API generation script when creating PRs that update `keras_export` public APIs:\n\n```\n./shell/api_gen.sh\n```\n\n#### Adding GPU support\n\nThe `requirements.txt` file will install a CPU-only version of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. For GPU support, we also\nprovide a separate `requirements-{backend}-cuda.txt` for TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. These install all CUDA\ndependencies via `pip` and expect a NVIDIA driver to be pre-installed. We recommend a clean python environment for each\nbackend to avoid CUDA version mismatches. As an example, here is how to create a Jax GPU environment with `conda`:\n\n```shell\nconda create -y -n keras-jax python=3.10\nconda activate keras-jax\npip install -r requirements-jax-cuda.txt\npython pip_build.py --install\n```\n\n## Configuring your backend\n\nYou can export the environment variable `KERAS_BACKEND` or you can edit your local config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`\nto configure your backend. Available backend options are: `\"tensorflow\"`, `\"jax\"`, `\"torch\"`. Example:\n\n```\nexport KERAS_BACKEND=\"jax\"\n```\n\nIn Colab, you can do:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"KERAS_BACKEND\"] = \"jax\"\n\nimport keras\n```\n\n**Note:** The backend must be configured before importing `keras`, and the backend cannot be changed after \nthe package has been imported.\n\n## Backwards compatibility\n\nKeras 3 is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for `tf.keras` (when using the TensorFlow backend). Just take your\nexisting `tf.keras` code, make sure that your calls to `model.save()` are using the up-to-date `.keras` format, and you're\ndone.\n\nIf your `tf.keras` model does not include custom components, you can start running it on top of JAX or PyTorch immediately.\n\nIf it does include custom components (e.g. custom layers or a custom `train_step()`), it is usually possible to convert it\nto a backend-agnostic implementation in just a few minutes.\n\nIn addition, Keras models can consume datasets in any format, regardless of the backend you're using:\nyou can train your models with your existing `tf.data.Dataset` pipelines or PyTorch `DataLoaders`.\n\n## Why use Keras 3?\n\n- Run your high-level Keras workflows on top of any framework -- benefiting at will from the advantages of each framework,\ne.g. the scalability and performance of JAX or the production ecosystem options of TensorFlow.\n- Write custom components (e.g. layers, models, metrics) that you can use in low-level workflows in any framework.\n    - You can take a Keras model and train it in a training loop written from scratch in native TF, JAX, or PyTorch.\n    - You can take a Keras model and use it as part of a PyTorch-native `Module` or as part of a JAX-native model function.\n- Make your ML code future-proof by avoiding framework lock-in.\n- As a PyTorch user: get access to power and usability of Keras, at last!\n- As a JAX user: get access to a fully-featured, battle-tested, well-documented modeling and training library.\n\n\nRead more in the [Keras 3 release announcement](https://keras.io/keras_3/).\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fc/a7/0d4490de967a67f68a538cc9cdb259bff971c4b5787f7765dc7c8f118f71/keras-2.15.0-py3-none-any.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2015 The TensorFlow Authors.

For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

To make the libclang\navailable without installing the LLVM toolkits, this package provides bundled static-linked libclang\nshared library for different platforms, which, should work well on OSX, Windows, as well as\nusual Linux distributions.\n\nThe aim of this project is to make the `clang.cindex` (aka., Clang Python Bindings)\navailable for more Python users, without setting up the LLVM environment. To install the package,\nyou just need to run\n\n```bash\npip install libclang\n```\n\nNote that the library is named `libclang`, the package `clang` on PyPi is another package and\ndoesn't bundle the prebuilt shared library.\n\nInternals\n---------\n\nUpdate class variable `library_path` of `Config` in `cindex.py` as:\n\n```python\n    library_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'native')\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis repository follows the license agreement of the LLVM project, see [Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception](./LICENSE.TXT).\n\n[1]: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/clang/bindings/python\n[2]: https://pypi.org/project/libclang\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c2/01/ec65dffc8c94bd8cafd359a76992f3212a239a80ead05522995c105432b8/libclang-16.0.6.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"==============================================================================\nThe LLVM Project is under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions:\n==============================================================================\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n    1.

IEEE 754, with NaN and inf.\n\n### `float8_e4m3b11fnuz`\n\nExponent: 4, Mantissa: 3, bias: 11.\n\nExtended range: no inf, NaN represented by 0b1000'0000.\n\n### `float8_e4m3fn`\n\nExponent: 4, Mantissa: 3, bias: 7.\n\nExtended range: no inf, NaN represented by 0bS111'1111.\n\nThe `fn` suffix is for consistency with the corresponding LLVM/MLIR type, signaling this type is not consistent with IEEE-754.  The `f` indicates it is finite values only. The `n` indicates it includes NaNs, but only at the outer range.\n\n### `float8_e4m3fnuz`\n\n8-bit floating point with 3 bit mantissa.\n\nAn 8-bit floating point type with 1 sign bit, 4 bits exponent and 3 bits mantissa. The suffix `fnuz` is consistent with LLVM/MLIR naming and is derived from the differences to IEEE floating point conventions. `F` is for \"finite\" (no infinities), `N` for with special NaN encoding, `UZ` for unsigned zero.\n\nThis type has the following characteristics:\n * bit encoding: S1E4M3 - `0bSEEEEMMM`\n * exponent bias: 8\n * infinities: Not supported\n * NaNs: Supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`\n * denormals when exponent is 0\n\n### `float8_e5m2`\n\nExponent: 5, Mantissa: 2, bias: 15. IEEE 754, with NaN and inf.\n\n### `float8_e5m2fnuz`\n\n8-bit floating point with 2 bit mantissa.\n\nAn 8-bit floating point type with 1 sign bit, 5 bits exponent and 2 bits mantissa. The suffix `fnuz` is consistent with LLVM/MLIR naming and is derived from the differences to IEEE floating point conventions. `F` is for \"finite\" (no infinities), `N` for with special NaN encoding, `UZ` for unsigned zero.\n\nThis type has the following characteristics:\n * bit encoding: S1E5M2 - `0bSEEEEEMM`\n * exponent bias: 16\n * infinities: Not supported\n * NaNs: Supported with sign bit set to 1, exponent bits and mantissa bits set to all 0s - `0b10000000`\n * denormals when exponent is 0\n\n## `int4` and `uint4`\n\n4-bit integer types, where each element is represented unpacked (i.e., padded up\nto a byte in memory).\n\nNumPy does not support types smaller than a single byte. For example, the\ndistance between adjacent elements in an array (`.strides`) is expressed in\nbytes. Relaxing this restriction would be a considerable engineering project.\nThe `int4` and `uint4` types therefore use an unpacked representation, where\neach element of the array is padded up to a byte in memory. The lower four bits\nof each byte contain the representation of the number, whereas the upper four\nbits are ignored.\n\n## Quirks of low-precision Arithmetic\n\nIf you're exploring the use of low-precision dtypes in your code, you should be\ncareful to anticipate when the precision loss might lead to surprising results.\nOne example is the behavior of aggregations like `sum`; consider this `bfloat16`\nsummation in NumPy (run with version 1.24.2):\n\n```python\n>>> from ml_dtypes import bfloat16\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=0)\n>>> vals = rng.uniform(size=10000).astype(bfloat16)\n>>> vals.sum()\n256\n```\nThe true sum should be close to 5000, but numpy returns exactly 256: this is\nbecause `bfloat16` does not have the precision to increment `256` by values less than\n`1`:\n\n```python\n>>> bfloat16(256) + bfloat16(1)\n256\n```\nAfter 256, the next representable value in bfloat16 is 258:\n\n```python\n>>> np.nextafter(bfloat16(256), bfloat16(np.inf))\n258\n```\nFor better results you can specify that the accumulation should happen in a\nhigher-precision type like `float32`:\n\n```python\n>>> vals.sum(dtype='float32').astype(bfloat16)\n4992\n```\nIn contrast to NumPy, projects like [JAX](http://jax.readthedocs.io/) which support\nlow-precision arithmetic more natively will often do these kinds of higher-precision\naccumulations automatically:\n\n```python\n>>> import jax.numpy as jnp\n>>> jnp.array(vals).sum()\nArray(4992, dtype=bfloat16)\n```\n\n## License\n\n*This is not an officially supported Google product.*\n\nThe `ml_dtypes` source code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license\n(see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2011 Intel Corporation.

Download & installation\n--------------------------\n\nMpmath requires Python 2.7 or 3.5 (or later versions). It has been tested\nwith CPython 2.7, 3.5 through 3.7 and for PyPy.\n\nThe latest release of mpmath can be downloaded from the mpmath\nwebsite and from https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/releases\n\nIt should also be available in the Python Package Index at\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpmath\n\nTo install latest release of Mpmath with pip, simply run\n\n``pip install mpmath``\n\nOr unpack the mpmath archive and run\n\n``python setup.py install``\n\nMpmath can also be installed using\n\n``python -m easy_install mpmath``\n\nThe latest development code is available from\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath\n\nSee the main documentation for more detailed instructions.\n\n2. Running tests\n----------------\n\nThe unit tests in mpmath/tests/ can be run via the script\nruntests.py, but it is recommended to run them with py.test\n(https://pytest.org/), especially\nto generate more useful reports in case there are failures.\n\nYou may also want to check out the demo scripts in the demo\ndirectory.\n\nThe master branch is automatically tested by Travis CI.\n\n3. Documentation\n----------------\n\nDocumentation in reStructuredText format is available in the\ndoc directory included with the source package. These files\nare human-readable, but can be compiled to prettier HTML using\nthe build.py script (requires Sphinx, http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).\n\nSee setup.txt in the documentation for more information.\n\nThe most recent documentation is also available in HTML format:\n\nhttp://mpmath.org/doc/current/\n\n4. Known problems\n-----------------\n\nMpmath is a work in progress. Major issues include:\n\n* Some functions may return incorrect values when given extremely\n  large arguments or arguments very close to singularities.\n\n* Directed rounding works for arithmetic operations. It is implemented\n  heuristically for other operations, and their results may be off by one\n  or two units in the last place (even if otherwise accurate).\n\n* Some IEEE 754 features are not available. Inifinities and NaN are\n  partially supported; denormal rounding is currently not available\n  at all.\n\n* The interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized.\n  The current method is not threadsafe.\n\n5. Help and bug reports\n-----------------------\n\nGeneral questions and comments can be sent to the mpmath mailinglist,\nmpmath@googlegroups.com\n\nYou can also report bugs and send patches to the mpmath issue tracker,\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/issues\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e0/47/dd32fa426cc72114383ac549964eecb20ecfd886d1e5ccf5340b55b02f57/mpmath-1.3.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2005-2021 Fredrik Johansson and mpmath contributors\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  a.

It behaves mostly like a regular ``dict`` but it may have\nseveral *values* for the same *key* and *preserves insertion ordering*.\n\nThe *key* is ``str`` (or ``istr`` for case-insensitive dictionaries).\n\n``multidict`` has four multidict classes:\n``MultiDict``, ``MultiDictProxy``, ``CIMultiDict``\nand ``CIMultiDictProxy``.\n\nImmutable proxies (``MultiDictProxy`` and\n``CIMultiDictProxy``) provide a dynamic view for the\nproxied multidict, the view reflects underlying collection changes. They\nimplement the ``collections.abc.Mapping`` interface.\n\nRegular mutable (``MultiDict`` and ``CIMultiDict``) classes\nimplement ``collections.abc.MutableMapping`` and allows them to change\ntheir own content.\n\n\n*Case insensitive* (``CIMultiDict`` and\n``CIMultiDictProxy``) assume the *keys* are case\ninsensitive, e.g.::\n\n   >>> dct = CIMultiDict(key='val')\n   >>> 'Key' in dct\n   True\n   >>> dct['Key']\n   'val'\n\n*Keys* should be ``str`` or ``istr`` instances.\n\nThe library has optional C Extensions for speed.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nApache 2\n\nLibrary Installation\n--------------------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   $ pip install multidict\n\nThe library is Python 3 only!\n\nPyPI contains binary wheels for Linux, Windows and MacOS.  If you want to install\n``multidict`` on another operating system (or *Alpine Linux* inside a Docker) the\ntarball will be used to compile the library from source.

A list of issues is located at https://github.com/uqfoundation/multiprocess/issues, with a legacy list maintained at https://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos/query.\n\n\nMajor Features\n==============\n\n``multiprocess`` enables:\n\n    - objects to be transferred between processes using pipes or multi-producer/multi-consumer queues\n    - objects to be shared between processes using a server process or (for simple data) shared memory\n\n``multiprocess`` provides:\n\n    - equivalents of all the synchronization primitives in ``threading``\n    - a ``Pool`` class to facilitate submitting tasks to worker processes\n    - enhanced serialization, using ``dill``\n\n\nCurrent Release\n===============\n\nThe latest released version of ``multiprocess`` is available from:\n\n    https://pypi.org/project/multiprocess\n\n``multiprocess`` is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license, and is a fork of ``multiprocessing``.\n\n\nDevelopment Version\n===================\n\nYou can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at:\n\n    https://github.com/uqfoundation\n\nIf you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``multiprocess`` can be installed with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install multiprocess\n\nFor Python 2, a C compiler is required to build the included extension module from source. Python 3 and binary installs do not require a C compiler.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n``multiprocess`` requires:\n\n    - ``python`` (or ``pypy``), **>=3.8**\n    - ``setuptools``, **>=42**\n    - ``dill``, **>=0.3.8**\n\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\nThe ``multiprocess.Process`` class follows the API of ``threading.Thread``.\nFor example ::\n\n    from multiprocess import Process, Queue\n\n    def f(q):\n        q.put('hello world')\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        q = Queue()\n        p = Process(target=f, args=[q])\n        p.start()\n        print (q.get())\n        p.join()\n\nSynchronization primitives like locks, semaphores and conditions are\navailable, for example ::\n\n    >>> from multiprocess import Condition\n    >>> c = Condition()\n    >>> print (c)\n    <Condition(<RLock(None, 0)>), 0>\n    >>> c.acquire()\n    True\n    >>> print (c)\n    <Condition(<RLock(MainProcess, 1)>), 0>\n\nOne can also use a manager to create shared objects either in shared\nmemory or in a server process, for example ::\n\n    >>> from multiprocess import Manager\n    >>> manager = Manager()\n    >>> l = manager.list(range(10))\n    >>> l.reverse()\n    >>> print (l)\n    [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n    >>> print (repr(l))\n    <Proxy[list] object at 0x00E1B3B0>\n\nTasks can be offloaded to a pool of worker processes in various ways,\nfor example ::\n\n    >>> from multiprocess import Pool\n    >>> def f(x): return x*x\n    ...\n    >>> p = Pool(4)\n    >>> result = p.map_async(f, range(10))\n    >>> print (result.get(timeout=1))\n    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n\nWhen ``dill`` is installed, serialization is extended to most objects,\nfor example ::\n\n    >>> from multiprocess import Pool\n    >>> p = Pool(4)\n    >>> print (p.map(lambda x: (lambda y:y**2)(x) + x, xrange(10)))\n    [0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]\n\n\nMore Information\n================\n\nProbably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at\nhttp://multiprocess.rtfd.io. Also see ``multiprocess.tests`` for scripts that\ndemonstrate how ``multiprocess`` can be used to leverge multiple processes\nto execute Python in parallel. You can run the test suite with\n``python -m multiprocess.tests``. As ``multiprocess`` conforms to the\n``multiprocessing`` interface, the examples and documentation found at\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html also apply to\n``multiprocess`` if one will ``import multiprocessing as multiprocess``.\nSee https://github.com/uqfoundation/multiprocess/tree/master/py3.12/examples\nfor a set of examples that demonstrate some basic use cases and benchmarking\nfor running Python code in parallel. Please feel free to submit a ticket on\ngithub, or ask a question on stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**). If you would\nlike to share how you use ``multiprocess`` in your work, please send an email\n(to **mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org**).\n\n\nCitation\n========\n\nIf you use ``multiprocess`` to do research that leads to publication, we ask that you\nacknowledge use of ``multiprocess`` by citing the following in your publication::\n\n    M.M.

For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n         (b) Representations.

If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.

Application of this License.\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n   6. Versions of the License.\n      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n         [1] A Developer specific license.\n         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n   8. TERMINATION.\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.","name":"OPL-1.0"}],"notes":[],"otherLicenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2022-2023 Intel Corporation\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.","name":"Apache-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2022 Intel Corporation\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n   d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\n   h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n   i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n   j.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.","name":"GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception"},{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 2011-2014 The OpenBLAS Project\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 3 or any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.","name":"CC0-1.0"},{"attribution":"Open Publication License\nv1.0, 8 June 1999\n\nI. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS\n\nThe Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.\n\nProper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:\n\n    Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).\n\nThe reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).\n\nCommercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is permitted.\n\nAny publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.\n\n\nII. COPYRIGHT\n\nThe copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee.\n\n\nIII. SCOPE OF LICENSE\n\nThe following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.\n\nMere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and appropriate copyright notice.\n\nSEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.\n\nNO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.\n\n\nIV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS\n\nAll modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements:\n\n   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.\n   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.\n   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.\n   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.\n   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's (or authors') permission. \n\n\nV. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\n\n   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\n   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\n   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s). \n\n\nVI. LICENSE OPTIONS\n\nThe author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.\n\nA. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the explicit permission of the author(s). \"Substantive modification\" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\nB. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\n\nOPEN PUBLICATION POLICY APPENDIX:\n\n(This is not considered part of the license.)\n\nOpen Publication works are available in source format via the Open Publication home page at http://works.opencontent.org/.\n\nOpen Publication authors who want to include their own license on Open Publication works may do so, as long as their terms are not more restrictive than the Open Publication license.\n\nIf you have questions about the Open Publication License, please contact David Wiley, and/or the Open Publication Authors' List at opal@opencontent.org, via email.\n\nTo subscribe to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"subscribe\" in the body.\n\nTo post to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal@opencontent.org or simply reply to a previous post.\n\nTo unsubscribe from the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"unsubscribe\" in the body.","name":"openpub"},{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 1993 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

There are several\nprominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or\nboth of the following:\n\n1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.\n2. They predate the `OAuth 2.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 6749.\n3. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.\n\n.. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849\n.. _`OAuth 2.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749\n\nOAuthLib is a framework which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without\nassuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth\nclient support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto your\nfavourite web framework. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin\nveneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nFull documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_.

More details can be found [here](https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/tree/main/roadmap)\n\n# Installation\n\n## Official Python packages\n\nONNX released packages are published in PyPi.\n\n```sh\npip install onnx  # or pip install onnx[reference] for optional reference implementation dependencies\n```\n\n[ONNX weekly packages](https://pypi.org/project/onnx-weekly/) are published in PyPI to enable experimentation and early testing.\n\n## vcpkg packages\n\nonnx is in the maintenance list of [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), you can easily use vcpkg to build and install it.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git\ncd vcpkg\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat # For powershell\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh # For bash\n./vcpkg install onnx\n```\n\n## Conda packages\n\nA binary build of ONNX is available from [Conda](https://conda.io), in [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/):\n\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge onnx\n```\n\n## Build ONNX from Source\n\nBefore building from source uninstall any existing versions of onnx `pip uninstall onnx`.\n\nc++17 or higher C++ compiler version is required to build ONNX from source. Still, users can specify their own `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` version for building ONNX.\n\nIf you don't have protobuf installed, ONNX will internally download and build protobuf for ONNX build.\n\nOr, you can manually install [protobuf C/C++ libraries and tools](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) with specified version before proceeding forward. Then depending on how you installed protobuf, you need to set environment variable CMAKE_ARGS to \"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\" or \"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=OFF\".  For example, you may need to run the following command:\n\nLinux:\n\n```sh\nexport CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\"\n```\n\nWindows:\n\n```bat\nset CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\"\n```\n\nThe ON/OFF depends on what kind of protobuf library you have. Shared libraries are files ending with \\*.dll/\\*.so/\\*.dylib. Static libraries are files ending with \\*.a/\\*.lib. This option depends on how you get your protobuf library and how it was built. And it is default OFF. You don't need to run the commands above if you'd prefer to use a static protobuf library.\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you are building ONNX from source, it is recommended that you also build Protobuf locally as a static library. The version distributed with conda-forge is a DLL, but ONNX expects it to be a static library. Building protobuf locally also lets you control the version of protobuf. The tested and recommended version is 3.21.12.\n\nThe instructions in this README assume you are using Visual Studio.  It is recommended that you run all the commands from a shell started from \"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019\" and keep the build system generator for cmake (e.g., cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\") consistent while building protobuf as well as ONNX.\n\nYou can get protobuf by running the following commands:\n\n```bat\ngit clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git\ncd protobuf\ngit checkout v21.12\ncd cmake\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<protobuf_install_dir> -Dprotobuf_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF .\nmsbuild protobuf.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release\nmsbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release\n```\n\nThen it will be built as a static library and installed to <protobuf_install_dir>. Please add the bin directory(which contains protoc.exe) to your PATH.\n\n```bat\nset PATH=<protobuf_install_dir>/bin;%PATH%\n```\n\nPlease note: if your protobuf_install_dir contains spaces, **do not** add quotation marks around it.\n\nAlternative: if you don't want to change your PATH, you can set ONNX_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE instead.\n\n```bat\nset CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=<full_path_to_protoc.exe>\n```\n\nThen you can build ONNX as:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/onnx/onnx.git\ncd onnx\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n# prefer lite proto\nset CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Linux\n\nFirst, you need to install protobuf. The minimum Protobuf compiler (protoc) version required by ONNX is 3.6.1. Please note that old protoc versions might not work with `CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON`.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 (and newer) users may choose to install protobuf via\n\n```sh\napt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler\n```\n\nIn this case, it is required to add `-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to CMAKE_ARGS in the ONNX build step.\n\nA more general way is to build and install it from source. See the instructions below for more details.\n\n<details>\n  <summary> Installing Protobuf from source </summary>\n\n  Debian/Ubuntu:\n\n  ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git\n    cd protobuf\n    git checkout v21.12\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    mkdir build_source && cd build_source\n    cmake ../cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    make install\n  ```\n\n  CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:\n\n  ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git\n    cd protobuf\n    git checkout v21.12\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    mkdir build_source && cd build_source\n    cmake ../cmake  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib64 -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    make install\n  ```\n\n  Here \"-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON\" is crucial. By default static libraries are built without \"-fPIC\" flag, they are not position independent code. But shared libraries must be position independent code. Python C/C++ extensions(like ONNX) are shared libraries. So if a static library was not built with \"-fPIC\", it can't be linked to such a shared library.\n\n  Once build is successful, update PATH to include protobuf paths.\n\n</details>\n\nThen you can build ONNX as:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/onnx/onnx.git\ncd onnx\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n# Optional: prefer lite proto\nexport CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Mac\n\n```sh\nexport NUM_CORES=`sysctl -n hw.ncpu`\nbrew update\nbrew install autoconf && brew install automake\nwget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/protobuf-cpp-3.21.12.tar.gz\ntar -xvf protobuf-cpp-3.21.12.tar.gz\ncd protobuf-3.21.12\nmkdir build_source && cd build_source\ncmake ../cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\nmake -j${NUM_CORES}\nmake install\n```\n\nOnce build is successful, update PATH to include protobuf paths.\n\nThen you can build ONNX as:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/onnx/onnx.git\ncd onnx\n# Optional: prefer lite proto\nset CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, run\n\n```sh\npython -c \"import onnx\"\n```\n\nto verify it works.\n\n## Common Build Options\n\nFor full list refer to CMakeLists.txt\n\n### Environment variables\n\n* `USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME` should be 1 or 0, not ON or OFF. When set to 1 onnx links statically to runtime library.\n**Default**: `USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME=0`\n\n* `DEBUG` should be 0 or 1. When set to 1 onnx is built in debug mode. or debug versions of the dependencies, you need to open the [CMakeLists file](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) and append a letter `d` at the end of the package name lines. For example, `NAMES protobuf-lite` would become `NAMES protobuf-lited`.\n**Default**: `Debug=0`\n\n### CMake variables\n\n* `ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS` should be `ON` or `OFF`.\n**Default**: `ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=OFF USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME=0`\n`ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS` determines how onnx links to protobuf libraries.\n  * When set to `ON` - onnx will dynamically link to protobuf shared libs, PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS will be defined as described [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/cmake/README.md#dlls-vs-static-linking), Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS will be set to `OFF` and `USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME` must be 0.\n  * When set to `OFF` - onnx will link statically to protobuf, and Protobuf_USE_STATIC_LIBS will be set to `ON` (to force the use of the static libraries) and `USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME` can be `0` or `1`.\n\n* `ONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO` should be `ON` or `OFF`. When set to `ON` onnx uses lite protobuf instead of full protobuf.\n**Default**: `ONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=OFF`\n\n* `ONNX_WERROR` should be `ON` or `OFF`. When set to `ON` warnings are treated as errors.\n**Default**: `ONNX_WERROR=OFF` in local builds, `ON` in CI and release pipelines.\n\n## Common Errors\n\n* Note: the `import onnx` command does not work from the source checkout directory; in this case you'll see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'onnx.onnx_cpp2py_export'`. Change into another directory to fix this error.\n\n* If you run into any issues while building Protobuf as a static library, please ensure that shared Protobuf libraries, like libprotobuf, are not installed on your device or in the conda environment. If these shared libraries exist, either remove them to build Protobuf from source as a static library, or skip the Protobuf build from source to use the shared version directly.\n\n* If you run into any issues while building ONNX from source, and your error message reads, `Could not find pythonXX.lib`, ensure that you have consistent Python versions for common commands, such as `python` and `pip`. Clean all existing build files and rebuild ONNX again.\n\n# Testing\n\nONNX uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) as test driver. In order to run tests, you will first need to install `pytest`:\n\n```sh\npip install pytest nbval\n```\n\nAfter installing pytest, use the following command to run tests.\n\n```sh\npytest\n```\n\n# Development\n\nCheck out the [contributor guide](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.\n\n# License\n\n[Apache License v2.0](LICENSE)\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\n[ONNX Open Source Code of Conduct](https://onnx.ai/codeofconduct.html)\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f7/08/9d107e9cdc9080d9ca2e8833087988ed202c88b224c3263ec3edc4ea2504/onnx-1.15.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_12_universal2.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.","name":"CC0-1.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2015 Wenzel Jakob <wenzel@inf.ethz.ch> .

License Grants and Conditions\n      2.1. Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2002 JSON.org\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nThe Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Optimized\neinsum is agnostic to the backend and can handle NumPy, Dask, PyTorch,\nTensorflow, CuPy, Sparse, Theano, JAX, and Autograd arrays as well as potentially\nany library which conforms to a standard API. See the\n[**documentation**](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io) for more\ninformation.\n\n## Example usage\n\nThe [`opt_einsum.contract`](https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autosummary/opt_einsum.contract.html#opt-einsum-contract)\nfunction can often act as a drop-in replacement for `einsum`\nfunctions without futher changes to the code while providing superior performance.\nHere, a tensor contraction is preformed with and without optimization:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom opt_einsum import contract\n\nN = 10\nC = np.random.rand(N, N)\nI = np.random.rand(N, N, N, N)\n\n%timeit np.einsum('pi,qj,ijkl,rk,sl->pqrs', C, C, I, C, C)\n1 loops, best of 3: 934 ms per loop\n\n%timeit contract('pi,qj,ijkl,rk,sl->pqrs', C, C, I, C, C)\n1000 loops, best of 3: 324 us per loop\n```\n\nIn this particular example, we see a ~3000x performance improvement which is\nnot uncommon when compared against unoptimized contractions. See the [backend\nexamples](https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html)\nfor more information on using other backends.\n\n## Features\n\nThe algorithms found in this repository often power the `einsum` optimizations\nin many of the above projects. For example, the optimization of `np.einsum`\nhas been passed upstream and most of the same features that can be found in\nthis repository can be enabled with `np.einsum(..., optimize=True)`. However,\nthis repository often has more up to date algorithms for complex contractions.\n\nThe following capabilities are enabled by `opt_einsum`:\n\n* Inspect [detailed information](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/path_finding.html) about the path chosen.\n* Perform contractions with [numerous backends](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html), including on the GPU and with libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).\n* Generate [reusable expressions](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reusing_paths.html), potentially with [constant tensors](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reusing_paths.html#specifying-constants), that can be compiled for greater performance.\n* Use an arbitrary number of indices to find contractions for [hundreds or even thousands of tensors](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ex_large_expr_with_greedy.html).\n* Share [intermediate computations](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing_intermediates.html) among multiple contractions.\n* Compute gradients of tensor contractions using [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) or [jax](https://github.com/google/jax)\n\nPlease see the [documentation](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for more features!\n\n\n## Installation\n\n`opt_einsum` can either be installed via `pip install opt_einsum` or from conda `conda install opt_einsum -c conda-forge`. See the installation [documenation](http://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for further methods.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf this code has benefited your research, please support us by citing:\n\nDaniel G.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)\n- [python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\n- [pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations](https://github.com/stub42/pytz)\n\nSee the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.\n\n## Installation from sources\nTo install pandas from source you need [Cython](https://cython.org/) in addition to the normal\ndependencies above.

It has been first written to support particular\nprotocol (SNMP) but then generalized to be suitable for a wide range\nof protocols based on\n[ASN.1 specification](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.208-198811-W!!PDF-E&type=items).\n\n**NOTE:** The package is now maintained by *Christian Heimes* and\n*Simon Pichugin* in project https://github.com/pyasn1/pyasn1.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Generic implementation of ASN.1 types (X.208)\n* Standards compliant BER/CER/DER codecs\n* Can operate on streams of serialized data\n* Dumps/loads ASN.1 structures from Python types\n* 100% Python, works with Python 3.8+\n* MT-safe\n* Contributed ASN.1 compiler [Asn1ate](https://github.com/kimgr/asn1ate)\n\nWhy using pyasn1\n----------------\n\nASN.1 solves the data serialisation problem. This solution was\ndesigned long ago by the wise Ancients. Back then, they did not\nhave the luxury of wasting bits. That is why ASN.1 is designed\nto serialise data structures of unbounded complexity into\nsomething compact and efficient when it comes to processing\nthe data.\n\nThat probably explains why many network protocols and file formats\nstill rely on the 30+ years old technology. Including a number of\nhigh-profile Internet protocols and file formats.\n\nQuite a number of books cover the topic of ASN.1. \n[Communication between heterogeneous systems](http://www.oss.com/asn1/dubuisson.html)\nby Olivier Dubuisson is one of those high quality books freely \navailable on the Internet.\n\nThe pyasn1 package is designed to help Python programmers tackling\nnetwork protocols and file formats at the comfort of their Python\nprompt. The tool struggles to capture all aspects of a rather\ncomplicated ASN.1 system and to represent it on the Python terms.\n\nHow to use pyasn1\n-----------------\n\nWith pyasn1 you can build Python objects from ASN.1 data structures.\nFor example, the following ASN.1 data structure:\n\n```bash\nRecord ::= SEQUENCE {\n  id        INTEGER,\n  room  [0] INTEGER OPTIONAL,\n  house [1] INTEGER DEFAULT 0\n}\n```\n\nCould be expressed in pyasn1 like this:\n\n```python\nclass Record(Sequence):\n    componentType = NamedTypes(\n        NamedType('id', Integer()),\n        OptionalNamedType(\n            'room', Integer().subtype(\n                implicitTag=Tag(tagClassContext, tagFormatSimple, 0)\n            )\n        ),\n        DefaultedNamedType(\n            'house', Integer(0).subtype(\n                implicitTag=Tag(tagClassContext, tagFormatSimple, 1)\n            )\n        )\n    )\n```\n\nIt is in the spirit of ASN.1 to take abstract data description \nand turn it into a programming language specific form.\nOnce you have your ASN.1 data structure expressed in Python, you\ncan use it along the lines of similar Python type (e.g. ASN.1\n`SET` is similar to Python `dict`, `SET OF` to `list`):\n\n```python\n>>> record = Record()\n>>> record['id'] = 123\n>>> record['room'] = 321\n>>> str(record)\nRecord:\n id=123\n room=321\n>>>\n```\n\nPart of the power of ASN.1 comes from its serialisation features. You\ncan serialise your data structure and send it over the network.\n\n```python\n>>> from pyasn1.codec.der.encoder import encode\n>>> substrate = encode(record)\n>>> hexdump(substrate)\n00000: 30 07 02 01 7B 80 02 01 41\n```\n\nConversely, you can turn serialised ASN.1 content, as received from\nnetwork or read from a file, into a Python object which you can\nintrospect, modify, encode and send back.\n\n```python\n>>> from pyasn1.codec.der.decoder import decode\n>>> received_record, rest_of_substrate = decode(substrate, asn1Spec=Record())\n>>>\n>>> for field in received_record:\n>>>    print('{} is {}'.format(field, received_record[field]))\nid is 123\nroom is 321\nhouse is 0\n>>>\n>>> record == received_record\nTrue\n>>> received_record.update(room=123)\n>>> substrate = encode(received_record)\n>>> hexdump(substrate)\n00000: 30 06 02 01 7B 80 01 7B\n```\n\nThe pyasn1 classes struggle to emulate their Python prototypes (e.g. int,\nlist, dict etc.). But ASN.1 types exhibit more complicated behaviour.\nTo make life easier for a Pythonista, they can turn their pyasn1\nclasses into Python built-ins:\n\n```python\n>>> from pyasn1.codec.native.encoder import encode\n>>> encode(record)\n{'id': 123, 'room': 321, 'house': 0}\n```\n\nOr vice-versa -- you can initialize an ASN.1 structure from a tree of\nPython objects:\n\n```python\n>>> from pyasn1.codec.native.decoder import decode\n>>> record = decode({'id': 123, 'room': 321, 'house': 0}, asn1Spec=Record())\n>>> str(record)\nRecord:\n id=123\n room=321\n>>>\n```\n\nWith ASN.1 design, serialisation codecs are decoupled from data objects,\nso you could turn every single ASN.1 object into many different \nserialised forms. As of this moment, pyasn1 supports BER, DER, CER and\nPython built-ins codecs. The extremely compact PER encoding is expected\nto be introduced in the upcoming pyasn1 release.\n\nMore information on pyasn1 APIs can be found in the\n[documentation](https://pyasn1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyasn1/contents.html),\ncompiled ASN.1 modules for different protocols and file formats\ncould be found in the pyasn1-modules \n[repo](https://github.com/pyasn1/pyasn1-modules).\n\nHow to get pyasn1\n-----------------\n\nThe pyasn1 package is distributed under terms and conditions of 2-clause\nBSD [license](https://pyasn1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/license.html).

Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\n* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\n* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\n  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\n  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\n  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\n  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\n  and Windows registry-based time zones.\n* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\n  Olson's database.\n* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\n  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\n* A comprehensive test suite.\n\nQuick example\n=============\nHere's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\npackage. For more examples, look at the documentation.\n\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\ndate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n    >>> from datetime import *\n    >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n    >>> today = now.date()\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n    >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\n    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n    >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n    >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).

This library allows\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\n\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\n\n.. note::\n\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\nstandard Python distutils.\n\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\n\n    pip install pytz\n\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\nadministrative user::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\npytz for Enterprise\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.

The\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\ninformation):\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\n\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\n\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\n\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Does not work this way!\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\n\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\nas UTC:\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Not recommended except for UTC\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\n\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\nby humans.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\n\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\ntimezone.\n\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\n\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\nsection for more details)\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\nstandard astimezone method.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\nTrue\n\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\ndeal with.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n\n\n``tzinfo`` API\n--------------\n\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\n\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\n\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\n\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used\nduring DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds\n3600\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 20:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\ndatetime.timedelta(0)\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\n'NST'\n\nIf ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise\nan ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError`` exception.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> import pytz.exceptions\n>>> try:\n...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.dst(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n\n\nProblems with Localtime\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes\nmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\nhappens:\n\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\n\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\n\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\n\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\n\n>>> import pickle, pytz\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\n17\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\n>>> new == dt\nTrue\n>>> new is dt\nFalse\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\nTrue\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\nTrue\n\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\nnot compare the same in Python.\n\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\nFalse\n\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\n\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\n\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\n\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\ntimes.\n\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\nTime:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\n\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\nthe entire hour:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\n\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\neasier:\n\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n\n\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\n\n\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\n'0:24:01'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\n'0:00:01'\n\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\n\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\nincluded for tests only!):\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\n>>> str(dt)\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\n\nNotice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are\ncorrect, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are\nactually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00'\n>>> str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00'\n\n\nCountry Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use\nfor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.\nIt returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant\ntzinfo instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:\n\n>>> print(' '.join(pytz.country_timezones['nz']))\nPacific/Auckland Pacific/Chatham\n\nThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country\nname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:\n\n>>> print(pytz.country_names['nz'])\nNew Zealand\n\n\nWhat is UTC\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n'UTC' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It is a successor to, but distinct\nfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal\nTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time\nmeasurement.\n\nAll other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like\nUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No\ndaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform\ndate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused\nby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or\nmobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.\n\n..  _Coordinated Universal Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\n\n\nHelpers\n~~~~~~~\n\nThere are two lists of timezones provided.\n\n``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can\nbe used.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones\n>>> len(all_timezones) >= 500\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in all_timezones\nTrue\n\n``common_timezones`` is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn't\ncontain deprecated zones or historical zones, except for a few I've\ndeemed in common usage, such as US/Eastern (open a bug report if you\nthink other timezones are deserving of being included here). It is also\na sequence of strings.\n\n>>> from pytz import common_timezones\n>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in common_timezones\nFalse\n>>> 'Australia/Melbourne' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Canada/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in all_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in common_timezones\nFalse\n\nBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are alphabetically\nsorted:\n\n>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]\n>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> common_timezones == common_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]\n>>> all_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n\n``all_timezones`` and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set, common_timezones_set\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in all_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Victoria' in common_timezones_set\nFalse\n\nYou can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countries\nusing the ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166\ntwo letter country code.\n\n>>> from pytz import country_timezones\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('ch')))\nEurope/Zurich\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('CH')))\nEurope/Zurich\n\n\nInternationalization - i18n/l10n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPytz is an interface to the IANA database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium's Unicode Locales (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_\nproject provides translations. Python packages such as\n`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_\nand Thomas Khyn's `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be used\nto access these translations from Python.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nMIT license.\n\nThis code is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope Public\nLicense,  Version 2.1 (ZPL).\n\nI'm happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in other\nopen source projects.\n\n\nLatest Versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package will be updated after releases of the Olson timezone\ndatabase.  The latest version can be downloaded from the `Python Package\nIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The code that is used\nto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and available\nusing git::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.git\n\nAnnouncements of new releases are made on\n`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the\n`Atom feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_\nhosted there.\n\n\nBugs, Feature Requests & Patches\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBugs should be reported on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.\nFeature requests are unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directed\nto timezone support now built into Python or packages that work with it.\n\n\nSecurity Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReports about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.\n\n\nIssues & Limitations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects using Python 3.9 or later\n  are best served by using the timezone functionaly now included in core\n  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n\n- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the nearest whole minute, so timezones\n  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will be up to 30 seconds out. This\n  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.\n\n- If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can't fix\n  it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and\n  changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.\n  If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing\n  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMore info than you want to know about timezones:\nhttps://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html\n\n\nContact\n~~~~~~~\n\nStuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/90/26/9f1f00a5d021fff16dee3de13d43e5e978f3d58928e129c3a62cf7eb9738/pytz-2024.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2003-2019 Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The last release that supported Python 2 was 2021.11.10.\n\nPyPy\n----\n\nThis module is targeted at CPython. It expects that all codepoints are the same width, so it won't behave properly with PyPy outside U+0000..U+007F because PyPy stores strings as UTF-8.\n\nMultithreading\n--------------\n\nThe regex module releases the GIL during matching on instances of the built-in (immutable) string classes, enabling other Python threads to run concurrently. It is also possible to force the regex module to release the GIL during matching by calling the matching methods with the keyword argument ``concurrent=True``. The behaviour is undefined if the string changes during matching, so use it *only* when it is guaranteed that that won't happen.\n\nUnicode\n-------\n\nThis module supports Unicode 15.1.0. Full Unicode case-folding is supported.\n\nFlags\n-----\n\nThere are 2 kinds of flag: scoped and global. Scoped flags can apply to only part of a pattern and can be turned on or off; global flags apply to the entire pattern and can only be turned on.\n\nThe scoped flags are: ``ASCII (?a)``, ``FULLCASE (?f)``, ``IGNORECASE (?i)``, ``LOCALE (?L)``, ``MULTILINE (?m)``, ``DOTALL (?s)``, ``UNICODE (?u)``, ``VERBOSE (?x)``, ``WORD (?w)``.\n\nThe global flags are: ``BESTMATCH (?b)``, ``ENHANCEMATCH (?e)``, ``POSIX (?p)``, ``REVERSE (?r)``, ``VERSION0 (?V0)``, ``VERSION1 (?V1)``.\n\nIf neither the ``ASCII``, ``LOCALE`` nor ``UNICODE`` flag is specified, it will default to ``UNICODE`` if the regex pattern is a Unicode string and ``ASCII`` if it's a bytestring.\n\nThe ``ENHANCEMATCH`` flag makes fuzzy matching attempt to improve the fit of the next match that it finds.\n\nThe ``BESTMATCH`` flag makes fuzzy matching search for the best match instead of the next match.\n\nOld vs new behaviour\n--------------------\n\nIn order to be compatible with the re module, this module has 2 behaviours:\n\n* **Version 0** behaviour (old behaviour, compatible with the re module):\n\n  Please note that the re module's behaviour may change over time, and I'll endeavour to match that behaviour in version 0.\n\n  * Indicated by the ``VERSION0`` flag.\n\n  * Zero-width matches are not handled correctly in the re module before Python 3.7. The behaviour in those earlier versions is:\n\n    * ``.split`` won't split a string at a zero-width match.\n\n    * ``.sub`` will advance by one character after a zero-width match.\n\n  * Inline flags apply to the entire pattern, and they can't be turned off.\n\n  * Only simple sets are supported.\n\n  * Case-insensitive matches in Unicode use simple case-folding by default.\n\n* **Version 1** behaviour (new behaviour, possibly different from the re module):\n\n  * Indicated by the ``VERSION1`` flag.\n\n  * Zero-width matches are handled correctly.\n\n  * Inline flags apply to the end of the group or pattern, and they can be turned off.\n\n  * Nested sets and set operations are supported.\n\n  * Case-insensitive matches in Unicode use full case-folding by default.\n\nIf no version is specified, the regex module will default to ``regex.DEFAULT_VERSION``.\n\nCase-insensitive matches in Unicode\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe regex module supports both simple and full case-folding for case-insensitive matches in Unicode. Use of full case-folding can be turned on using the ``FULLCASE`` flag. Please note that this flag affects how the ``IGNORECASE`` flag works; the ``FULLCASE`` flag itself does not turn on case-insensitive matching.\n\nVersion 0 behaviour: the flag is off by default.\n\nVersion 1 behaviour: the flag is on by default.\n\nNested sets and set operations\n------------------------------\n\nIt's not possible to support both simple sets, as used in the re module, and nested sets at the same time because of a difference in the meaning of an unescaped ``\"[\"`` in a set.\n\nFor example, the pattern ``[[a-z]--[aeiou]]`` is treated in the version 0 behaviour (simple sets, compatible with the re module) as:\n\n* Set containing \"[\" and the letters \"a\" to \"z\"\n\n* Literal \"--\"\n\n* Set containing letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"\n\n* Literal \"]\"\n\nbut in the version 1 behaviour (nested sets, enhanced behaviour) as:\n\n* Set which is:\n\n  * Set containing the letters \"a\" to \"z\"\n\n* but excluding:\n\n  * Set containing the letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"\n\nVersion 0 behaviour: only simple sets are supported.\n\nVersion 1 behaviour: nested sets and set operations are supported.\n\nNotes on named groups\n---------------------\n\nAll groups have a group number, starting from 1.\n\nGroups with the same group name will have the same group number, and groups with a different group name will have a different group number.\n\nThe same name can be used by more than one group, with later captures 'overwriting' earlier captures. All the captures of the group will be available from the ``captures`` method of the match object.\n\nGroup numbers will be reused across different branches of a branch reset, eg. ``(?|(first)|(second))`` has only group 1. If groups have different group names then they will, of course, have different group numbers, eg. ``(?|(?P<foo>first)|(?P<bar>second))`` has group 1 (\"foo\") and group 2 (\"bar\").\n\nIn the regex ``(\\s+)(?|(?P<foo>[A-Z]+)|(\\w+) (?P<foo>[0-9]+)`` there are 2 groups:\n\n* ``(\\s+)`` is group 1.\n\n* ``(?P<foo>[A-Z]+)`` is group 2, also called \"foo\".\n\n* ``(\\w+)`` is group 2 because of the branch reset.\n\n* ``(?P<foo>[0-9]+)`` is group 2 because it's called \"foo\".\n\nIf you want to prevent ``(\\w+)`` from being group 2, you need to name it (different name, different group number).\n\nAdditional features\n-------------------\n\nThe issue numbers relate to the Python bug tracker, except where listed otherwise.\n\nAdded ``\\p{Horiz_Space}`` and ``\\p{Vert_Space}`` (`GitHub issue 477 <https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/477#issuecomment-1216779547>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``\\p{Horiz_Space}`` or ``\\p{H}`` matches horizontal whitespace and ``\\p{Vert_Space}`` or ``\\p{V}`` matches vertical whitespace.\n\nAdded support for lookaround in conditional pattern (`Hg issue 163 <https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/163>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe test of a conditional pattern can be a lookaround.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> regex.match(r'(?(?=\\d)\\d+|\\w+)', '123abc')\n  <regex.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='123'>\n  >>> regex.match(r'(?(?=\\d)\\d+|\\w+)', 'abc123')\n  <regex.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='abc123'>\n\nThis is not quite the same as putting a lookaround in the first branch of a pair of alternatives.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> print(regex.match(r'(?:(?=\\d)\\d+\\b|\\w+)', '123abc'))\n  <regex.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='123abc'>\n  >>> print(regex.match(r'(?(?=\\d)\\d+\\b|\\w+)', '123abc'))\n  None\n\nIn the first example, the lookaround matched, but the remainder of the first branch failed to match, and so the second branch was attempted, whereas in the second example, the lookaround matched, and the first branch failed to match, but the second branch was **not** attempted.\n\nAdded POSIX matching (leftmost longest) (`Hg issue 150 <https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/150>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe POSIX standard for regex is to return the leftmost longest match.

(You cannot specify only a minimum.)\n\nThe 3 types of error are:\n\n* Insertion, indicated by \"i\"\n\n* Deletion, indicated by \"d\"\n\n* Substitution, indicated by \"s\"\n\nIn addition, \"e\" indicates any type of error.\n\nThe fuzziness of a regex item is specified between \"{\" and \"}\" after the item.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ``foo`` match \"foo\" exactly\n\n* ``(?:foo){i}`` match \"foo\", permitting insertions\n\n* ``(?:foo){d}`` match \"foo\", permitting deletions\n\n* ``(?:foo){s}`` match \"foo\", permitting substitutions\n\n* ``(?:foo){i,s}`` match \"foo\", permitting insertions and substitutions\n\n* ``(?:foo){e}`` match \"foo\", permitting errors\n\nIf a certain type of error is specified, then any type not specified will **not** be permitted.\n\nIn the following examples I'll omit the item and write only the fuzziness:\n\n* ``{d<=3}`` permit at most 3 deletions, but no other types\n\n* ``{i<=1,s<=2}`` permit at most 1 insertion and at most 2 substitutions, but no deletions\n\n* ``{1<=e<=3}`` permit at least 1 and at most 3 errors\n\n* ``{i<=2,d<=2,e<=3}`` permit at most 2 insertions, at most 2 deletions, at most 3 errors in total, but no substitutions\n\nIt's also possible to state the costs of each type of error and the maximum permitted total cost.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ``{2i+2d+1s<=4}`` each insertion costs 2, each deletion costs 2, each substitution costs 1, the total cost must not exceed 4\n\n* ``{i<=1,d<=1,s<=1,2i+2d+1s<=4}`` at most 1 insertion, at most 1 deletion, at most 1 substitution; each insertion costs 2, each deletion costs 2, each substitution costs 1, the total cost must not exceed 4\n\nYou can also use \"<\" instead of \"<=\" if you want an exclusive minimum or maximum.\n\nYou can add a test to perform on a character that's substituted or inserted.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ``{s<=2:[a-z]}`` at most 2 substitutions, which must be in the character set ``[a-z]``.\n\n* ``{s<=2,i<=3:\\d}`` at most 2 substitutions, at most 3 insertions, which must be digits.\n\nBy default, fuzzy matching searches for the first match that meets the given constraints. The ``ENHANCEMATCH`` flag will cause it to attempt to improve the fit (i.e. reduce the number of errors) of the match that it has found.\n\nThe ``BESTMATCH`` flag will make it search for the best match instead.\n\nFurther examples to note:\n\n* ``regex.search(\"(dog){e}\", \"cat and dog\")[1]`` returns ``\"cat\"`` because that matches ``\"dog\"`` with 3 errors (an unlimited number of errors is permitted).\n\n* ``regex.search(\"(dog){e<=1}\", \"cat and dog\")[1]`` returns ``\" dog\"`` (with a leading space) because that matches ``\"dog\"`` with 1 error, which is within the limit.\n\n* ``regex.search(\"(?e)(dog){e<=1}\", \"cat and dog\")[1]`` returns ``\"dog\"`` (without a leading space) because the fuzzy search matches ``\" dog\"`` with 1 error, which is within the limit, and the ``(?e)`` then it attempts a better fit.\n\nIn the first two examples there are perfect matches later in the string, but in neither case is it the first possible match.\n\nThe match object has an attribute ``fuzzy_counts`` which gives the total number of substitutions, insertions and deletions.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> # A 'raw' fuzzy match:\n  >>> regex.fullmatch(r\"(?:cats|cat){e<=1}\", \"cat\").fuzzy_counts\n  (0, 0, 1)\n  >>> # 0 substitutions, 0 insertions, 1 deletion.\n\n  >>> # A better match might be possible if the ENHANCEMATCH flag used:\n  >>> regex.fullmatch(r\"(?e)(?:cats|cat){e<=1}\", \"cat\").fuzzy_counts\n  (0, 0, 0)\n  >>> # 0 substitutions, 0 insertions, 0 deletions.\n\nThe match object also has an attribute ``fuzzy_changes`` which gives a tuple of the positions of the substitutions, insertions and deletions.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> m = regex.search('(fuu){i<=2,d<=2,e<=5}', 'anaconda foo bar')\n  >>> m\n  <regex.Match object; span=(7, 10), match='a f', fuzzy_counts=(0, 2, 2)>\n  >>> m.fuzzy_changes\n  ([], [7, 8], [10, 11])\n\nWhat this means is that if the matched part of the string had been:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  'anacondfuuoo bar'\n\nit would've been an exact match.\n\nHowever, there were insertions at positions 7 and 8:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  'anaconda fuuoo bar'\n          ^^\n\nand deletions at positions 10 and 11:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  'anaconda f~~oo bar'\n             ^^\n\nSo the actual string was:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  'anaconda foo bar'\n\nNamed lists ``\\L<name>`` (`Hg issue 11 <https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/11>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThere are occasions where you may want to include a list (actually, a set) of options in a regex.\n\nOne way is to build the pattern like this:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> p = regex.compile(r\"first|second|third|fourth|fifth\")\n\nbut if the list is large, parsing the resulting regex can take considerable time, and care must also be taken that the strings are properly escaped and properly ordered, for example, \"cats\" before \"cat\".\n\nThe new alternative is to use a named list:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> option_set = [\"first\", \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\", \"fifth\"]\n  >>> p = regex.compile(r\"\\L<options>\", options=option_set)\n\nThe order of the items is irrelevant, they are treated as a set. The named lists are available as the ``.named_lists`` attribute of the pattern object :\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> print(p.named_lists)\n  {'options': frozenset({'third', 'first', 'fifth', 'fourth', 'second'})}\n\nIf there are any unused keyword arguments, ``ValueError`` will be raised unless you tell it otherwise:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> option_set = [\"first\", \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\", \"fifth\"]\n  >>> p = regex.compile(r\"\\L<options>\", options=option_set, other_options=[])\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 353, in compile\n      return _compile(pattern, flags, ignore_unused, kwargs, cache_pattern)\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 500, in _compile\n      complain_unused_args()\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 483, in complain_unused_args\n      raise ValueError('unused keyword argument {!a}'.format(any_one))\n  ValueError: unused keyword argument 'other_options'\n  >>> p = regex.compile(r\"\\L<options>\", options=option_set, other_options=[], ignore_unused=True)\n  >>> p = regex.compile(r\"\\L<options>\", options=option_set, other_options=[], ignore_unused=False)\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 353, in compile\n      return _compile(pattern, flags, ignore_unused, kwargs, cache_pattern)\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 500, in _compile\n      complain_unused_args()\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 483, in complain_unused_args\n      raise ValueError('unused keyword argument {!a}'.format(any_one))\n  ValueError: unused keyword argument 'other_options'\n  >>>\n\nStart and end of word\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``\\m`` matches at the start of a word.\n\n``\\M`` matches at the end of a word.\n\nCompare with ``\\b``, which matches at the start or end of a word.\n\nUnicode line separators\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNormally the only line separator is ``\\n`` (``\\x0A``), but if the ``WORD`` flag is turned on then the line separators are ``\\x0D\\x0A``, ``\\x0A``, ``\\x0B``, ``\\x0C`` and ``\\x0D``, plus ``\\x85``, ``\\u2028`` and ``\\u2029`` when working with Unicode.\n\nThis affects the regex dot ``\".\"``, which, with the ``DOTALL`` flag turned off, matches any character except a line separator. It also affects the line anchors ``^`` and ``$`` (in multiline mode).\n\nSet operators\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n**Version 1 behaviour only**\n\nSet operators have been added, and a set ``[...]`` can include nested sets.\n\nThe operators, in order of increasing precedence, are:\n\n* ``||`` for union (\"x||y\" means \"x or y\")\n\n* ``~~`` (double tilde) for symmetric difference (\"x~~y\" means \"x or y, but not both\")\n\n* ``&&`` for intersection (\"x&&y\" means \"x and y\")\n\n* ``--`` (double dash) for difference (\"x--y\" means \"x but not y\")\n\nImplicit union, ie, simple juxtaposition like in ``[ab]``, has the highest precedence. Thus, ``[ab&&cd]`` is the same as ``[[a||b]&&[c||d]]``.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ``[ab]`` # Set containing 'a' and 'b'\n\n* ``[a-z]`` # Set containing 'a' .. 'z'\n\n* ``[[a-z]--[qw]]`` # Set containing 'a' .. 'z', but not 'q' or 'w'\n\n* ``[a-z--qw]`` # Same as above\n\n* ``[\\p{L}--QW]`` # Set containing all letters except 'Q' and 'W'\n\n* ``[\\p{N}--[0-9]]`` # Set containing all numbers except '0' .. '9'\n\n* ``[\\p{ASCII}&&\\p{Letter}]`` # Set containing all characters which are ASCII and letter\n\nregex.escape (`issue #2650 <https://bugs.python.org/issue2650>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nregex.escape has an additional keyword parameter ``special_only``. When True, only 'special' regex characters, such as '?', are escaped.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> regex.escape(\"foo!?\", special_only=False)\n  'foo\\\\!\\\\?'\n  >>> regex.escape(\"foo!?\", special_only=True)\n  'foo!\\\\?'\n\nregex.escape (`Hg issue 249 <https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex/issues/249>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nregex.escape has an additional keyword parameter ``literal_spaces``.

These methods are:\n\n* ``matchobject.captures([group1, ...])``\n\n  * Returns a list of the strings matched in a group or groups. Compare with ``matchobject.group([group1, ...])``.\n\n* ``matchobject.starts([group])``\n\n  * Returns a list of the start positions. Compare with ``matchobject.start([group])``.\n\n* ``matchobject.ends([group])``\n\n  * Returns a list of the end positions. Compare with ``matchobject.end([group])``.\n\n* ``matchobject.spans([group])``\n\n  * Returns a list of the spans. Compare with ``matchobject.span([group])``.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> m = regex.search(r\"(\\w{3})+\", \"123456789\")\n  >>> m.group(1)\n  '789'\n  >>> m.captures(1)\n  ['123', '456', '789']\n  >>> m.start(1)\n  6\n  >>> m.starts(1)\n  [0, 3, 6]\n  >>> m.end(1)\n  9\n  >>> m.ends(1)\n  [3, 6, 9]\n  >>> m.span(1)\n  (6, 9)\n  >>> m.spans(1)\n  [(0, 3), (3, 6), (6, 9)]\n\nAtomic grouping ``(?>...)`` (`issue #433030 <https://bugs.python.org/issue433030>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf the following pattern subsequently fails, then the subpattern as a whole will fail.\n\nPossessive quantifiers\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``(?:...)?+`` ; ``(?:...)*+`` ; ``(?:...)++`` ; ``(?:...){min,max}+``\n\nThe subpattern is matched up to 'max' times. If the following pattern subsequently fails, then all the repeated subpatterns will fail as a whole. For example, ``(?:...)++`` is equivalent to ``(?>(?:...)+)``.\n\nScoped flags (`issue #433028 <https://bugs.python.org/issue433028>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``(?flags-flags:...)``\n\nThe flags will apply only to the subpattern. Flags can be turned on or off.\n\nDefinition of 'word' character (`issue #1693050 <https://bugs.python.org/issue1693050>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe definition of a 'word' character has been expanded for Unicode. It conforms to the Unicode specification at ``http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/``.\n\nVariable-length lookbehind\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA lookbehind can match a variable-length string.\n\nFlags argument for regex.split, regex.sub and regex.subn (`issue #3482 <https://bugs.python.org/issue3482>`_)\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``regex.split``, ``regex.sub`` and ``regex.subn`` support a 'flags' argument.\n\nPos and endpos arguments for regex.sub and regex.subn\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``regex.sub`` and ``regex.subn`` support 'pos' and 'endpos' arguments.\n\n'Overlapped' argument for regex.findall and regex.finditer\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``regex.findall`` and ``regex.finditer`` support an 'overlapped' flag which permits overlapped matches.\n\nSplititer\n^^^^^^^^^\n\n``regex.splititer`` has been added. It's a generator equivalent of ``regex.split``.\n\nSubscripting match objects for groups\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA match object accepts access to the groups via subscripting and slicing:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> m = regex.search(r\"(?P<before>.*?)(?P<num>\\d+)(?P<after>.*)\", \"pqr123stu\")\n  >>> print(m[\"before\"])\n  pqr\n  >>> print(len(m))\n  4\n  >>> print(m[:])\n  ('pqr123stu', 'pqr', '123', 'stu')\n\nNamed groups\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nGroups can be named with ``(?<name>...)`` as well as the existing ``(?P<name>...)``.\n\nGroup references\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nGroups can be referenced within a pattern with ``\\g<name>``. This also allows there to be more than 99 groups.\n\nNamed characters ``\\N{name}``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nNamed characters are supported. Note that only those known by Python's Unicode database will be recognised.\n\nUnicode codepoint properties, including scripts and blocks\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``\\p{property=value}``; ``\\P{property=value}``; ``\\p{value}`` ; ``\\P{value}``\n\nMany Unicode properties are supported, including blocks and scripts. ``\\p{property=value}`` or ``\\p{property:value}`` matches a character whose property ``property`` has value ``value``. The inverse of ``\\p{property=value}`` is ``\\P{property=value}`` or ``\\p{^property=value}``.\n\nIf the short form ``\\p{value}`` is used, the properties are checked in the order: ``General_Category``, ``Script``, ``Block``, binary property:\n\n* ``Latin``, the 'Latin' script (``Script=Latin``).\n\n* ``BasicLatin``, the 'BasicLatin' block (``Block=BasicLatin``).\n\n* ``Alphabetic``, the 'Alphabetic' binary property (``Alphabetic=Yes``).\n\nA short form starting with ``Is`` indicates a script or binary property:\n\n* ``IsLatin``, the 'Latin' script (``Script=Latin``).\n\n* ``IsAlphabetic``, the 'Alphabetic' binary property (``Alphabetic=Yes``).\n\nA short form starting with ``In`` indicates a block property:\n\n* ``InBasicLatin``, the 'BasicLatin' block (``Block=BasicLatin``).\n\nPOSIX character classes\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``[[:alpha:]]``; ``[[:^alpha:]]``\n\nPOSIX character classes are supported. These are normally treated as an alternative form of ``\\p{...}``.\n\nThe exceptions are ``alnum``, ``digit``, ``punct`` and ``xdigit``, whose definitions are different from those of Unicode.\n\n``[[:alnum:]]`` is equivalent to ``\\p{posix_alnum}``.\n\n``[[:digit:]]`` is equivalent to ``\\p{posix_digit}``.\n\n``[[:punct:]]`` is equivalent to ``\\p{posix_punct}``.\n\n``[[:xdigit:]]`` is equivalent to ``\\p{posix_xdigit}``.\n\nSearch anchor ``\\G``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA search anchor has been added. It matches at the position where each search started/continued and can be used for contiguous matches or in negative variable-length lookbehinds to limit how far back the lookbehind goes:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> regex.findall(r\"\\w{2}\", \"abcd ef\")\n  ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']\n  >>> regex.findall(r\"\\G\\w{2}\", \"abcd ef\")\n  ['ab', 'cd']\n\n* The search starts at position 0 and matches 'ab'.\n\n* The search continues at position 2 and matches 'cd'.\n\n* The search continues at position 4 and fails to match any letters.\n\n* The anchor stops the search start position from being advanced, so there are no more results.\n\nReverse searching\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSearches can also work backwards:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> regex.findall(r\".\", \"abc\")\n  ['a', 'b', 'c']\n  >>> regex.findall(r\"(?r).\", \"abc\")\n  ['c', 'b', 'a']\n\nNote that the result of a reverse search is not necessarily the reverse of a forward search:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> regex.findall(r\"..\", \"abcde\")\n  ['ab', 'cd']\n  >>> regex.findall(r\"(?r)..\", \"abcde\")\n  ['de', 'bc']\n\nMatching a single grapheme ``\\X``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe grapheme matcher is supported. It conforms to the Unicode specification at ``http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/``.\n\nBranch reset ``(?|...|...)``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nGroup numbers will be reused across the alternatives, but groups with different names will have different group numbers.\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> regex.match(r\"(?|(first)|(second))\", \"first\").groups()\n  ('first',)\n  >>> regex.match(r\"(?|(first)|(second))\", \"second\").groups()\n  ('second',)\n\nNote that there is only one group.\n\nDefault Unicode word boundary\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe ``WORD`` flag changes the definition of a 'word boundary' to that of a default Unicode word boundary. This applies to ``\\b`` and ``\\B``.\n\nTimeout\n^^^^^^^\n\nThe matching methods and functions support timeouts. The timeout (in seconds) applies to the entire operation:\n\n.. sourcecode:: python\n\n  >>> from time import sleep\n  >>>\n  >>> def fast_replace(m):\n  ...     return 'X'\n  ...\n  >>> def slow_replace(m):\n  ...     sleep(0.5)\n  ...     return 'X'\n  ...\n  >>> regex.sub(r'[a-z]', fast_replace, 'abcde', timeout=2)\n  'XXXXX'\n  >>> regex.sub(r'[a-z]', slow_replace, 'abcde', timeout=2)\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    File \"C:\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\regex\\regex.py\", line 278, in sub\n      return pat.sub(repl, string, count, pos, endpos, concurrent, timeout)\n  TimeoutError: regex timed out\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b5/39/31626e7e75b187fae7f121af3c538a991e725c744ac893cc2cfd70ce2853/regex-2023.12.25.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"This work was derived from the 're' module of CPython 2.6 and CPython 3.1,\ncopyright (c) 1998-2001 by Secret Labs AB and licensed under CNRI's Python 1.6\nlicense.\n\nAll additions and alterations are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\n\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Luckily,\nrequests_oauthlib hides most of these and let you focus at the task at hand.\n\nAccessing protected resources using requests_oauthlib is as simple as:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1Session\n    >>> twitter = OAuth1Session('client_key',\n                                client_secret='client_secret',\n                                resource_owner_key='resource_owner_key',\n                                resource_owner_secret='resource_owner_secret')\n    >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1/account/settings.json'\n    >>> r = twitter.get(url)\n\nBefore accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from your\nprovider (e.g. Twitter) and authorization from the user for whom you wish to\nretrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the full\n`OAuth 1 workflow guide on RTD <https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth1_workflow.html>`_.\n\nThe OAuth 2 workflow\n--------------------\n\nOAuth 2 is generally simpler than OAuth 1 but comes in more flavours. The most\ncommon being the Authorization Code Grant, also known as the WebApplication\nflow.\n\nFetching a protected resource after obtaining an access token can be extremely\nsimple. However, before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few\ncredentials from your provider (e.g. Google) and authorization from the user\nfor whom you wish to retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the\nfull `OAuth 2 workflow guide on RTD <https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html>`_.\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n\nTo install requests and requests_oauthlib you can use pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install requests requests-oauthlib\n\n.. |build-status| image:: https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg\n   :target: https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/actions\n.. |coverage-status| image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/requests/requests-oauthlib.svg\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/requests/requests-oauthlib\n.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/requests-oauthlib/badge/\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n   :scale: 100%\n   :target: https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nv2.0.0 (22 March 2024)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFull set of changes are in [github](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/milestone/4?closed=1).\n\nAdditions & changes:\n\n- ``OAuth2Session`` now correctly uses the ``self.verify`` value if ``verify``\n  is not overridden in ``fetch_token`` and ``refresh_token``. Fixes `#404\n  <https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/issues/404>`_.\n- ``OAuth2Session`` constructor now uses its ``client.scope`` when a ``client``\n  is provided and ``scope`` is not overridden. Fixes `#408\n  <https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/issues/408>`_\n- Add ``refresh_token_request`` and ``access_token_request`` compliance hooks\n- Add PKCE support and Auth0 example\n- Add support for Python 3.8-3.12\n- Remove support of Python 2.x, <3.7\n- Migrated to Github Action\n- Updated dependencies\n- Cleanup some docs and examples\n\nv1.4.0 (27 Feb 2024)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Version 2.0.0 published initially as 1.4.0, it was yanked eventually.\n\nv1.3.1 (21 January 2022)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Add initial support for OAuth Mutual TLS (draft-ietf-oauth-mtls)\n- Removed outdated LinkedIn Compliance Fixes\n- Add eBay compliance fix\n- Add Spotify OAuth 2 Tutorial\n- Add support for python 3.8, 3.9\n- Fixed LinkedIn Compliance Fixes\n- Fixed ReadTheDocs Documentation and sphinx errors\n- Moved pipeline to GitHub Actions\n\nv1.3.0 (6 November 2019)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Instagram compliance fix\n- Added ``force_querystring`` argument to fetch_token() method on OAuth2Session\n\nv1.2.0 (14 January 2019)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- This project now depends on OAuthlib 3.0.0 and above. It does **not** support\n  versions of OAuthlib before 3.0.0.\n- Updated oauth2 tests to use 'sess' for an OAuth2Session instance instead of `auth`\n  because OAuth2Session objects and methods acceept an `auth` paramether which is\n  typically an instance of `requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth`\n- `OAuth2Session.fetch_token` previously tried to guess how and where to provide\n  \"client\" and \"user\" credentials incorrectly. This was incompatible with some\n  OAuth servers and incompatible with breaking changes in oauthlib that seek to\n  correctly provide the `client_id`. The older implementation also did not raise\n  the correct exceptions when username and password are not present on Legacy\n  clients.\n- Avoid automatic netrc authentication for OAuth2Session.\n\nv1.1.0 (9 January 2019)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Adjusted version specifier for ``oauthlib`` dependency: this project is\n  not yet compatible with ``oauthlib`` 3.0.0.\n- Dropped dependency on ``nose``.\n- Minor changes to clean up the code and make it more readable/maintainable.\n\nv1.0.0 (4 June 2018)\n++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- **Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3.**\n  This project now supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.4 and above.\n- Added several examples to the documentation.\n- Added plentymarkets compliance fix.\n- Added a ``token`` property to OAuth1Session, to match the corresponding\n  ``token`` property on OAuth2Session.\n\nv0.8.0 (14 February 2017)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added Fitbit compliance fix.\n- Fixed an issue where newlines in the response body for the access token\n  request would cause errors when trying to extract the token.\n- Fixed an issue introduced in v0.7.0 where users passing ``auth`` to several\n  methods would encounter conflicts with the ``client_id`` and\n  ``client_secret``-derived auth. The user-supplied ``auth`` argument is now\n  used in preference to those options.\n\nv0.7.0 (22 September 2016)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Allowed ``OAuth2Session.request`` to take the ``client_id`` and\n  ``client_secret`` parameters for the purposes of automatic token refresh,\n  which may need them.\n\nv0.6.2 (12 July 2016)\n+++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Use ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` for the Authorization header if\n  provided.\n- Allow explicit bypass of the Authorization header by setting ``auth=False``.\n- Pass through the ``proxies`` kwarg when refreshing tokens.\n- Miscellaneous cleanups.\n\nv0.6.1 (19 February 2016)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Fixed a bug when sending authorization in headers with no username and\n  password present.\n- Make sure we clear the session token before obtaining a new one.\n- Some improvements to the Slack compliance fix.\n- Avoid timing problems around token refresh.\n- Allow passing arbitrary arguments to requests when calling\n  ``fetch_request_token`` and ``fetch_access_token``.\n\nv0.6.0 (14 December 2015)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Add compliance fix for Slack.\n- Add compliance fix for Mailchimp.\n- ``TokenRequestDenied`` exceptions now carry the entire response, not just the\n  status code.\n- Pass through keyword arguments when refreshing tokens automatically.\n- Send authorization in headers, not just body, to maximize compatibility.\n- More getters/setters available for OAuth2 session client values.\n- Allow sending custom headers when refreshing tokens, and set some defaults.\n\n\nv0.5.0 (4 May 2015)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n- Fix ``TypeError`` being raised instead of ``TokenMissing`` error.\n- Raise requests exceptions on 4XX and 5XX responses in the OAuth2 flow.\n- Avoid ``AttributeError`` when initializing the ``OAuth2Session`` class\n  without complete client information.\n\nv0.4.2 (16 October 2014)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n- New ``authorized`` property on OAuth1Session and OAuth2Session, which allows\n  you to easily determine if the session is already authorized with OAuth tokens\n  or not.\n- New ``TokenMissing`` and ``VerifierMissing`` exception classes for OAuth1Session:\n  this will make it easier to catch and identify these exceptions.\n\nv0.4.1 (6 June 2014)\n++++++++++++++++++++\n- New install target ``[rsa]`` for people using OAuth1 RSA-SHA1 signature\n  method.\n- Fixed bug in OAuth2 where supplied state param was not used in auth url.\n- OAuth2 HTTPS checking can be disabled by setting environment variable\n  ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT``.\n- OAuth1 now re-authorize upon redirects.\n- OAuth1 token fetching now raise a detailed error message when the\n  response body is incorrectly encoded or the request was denied.\n- Added support for custom OAuth1 clients.\n- OAuth2 compliance fix for Sina Weibo.\n- Multiple fixes to facebook compliance fix.\n- Compliance fixes now re-encode body properly as bytes in Python 3.\n- Logging now properly done under ``requests_oauthlib`` namespace instead\n  of piggybacking on oauthlib namespace.\n- Logging introduced for OAuth1 auth and session.\n\nv0.4.0 (29 September 2013)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n- OAuth1Session methods only return unicode strings. #55.\n- Renamed requests_oauthlib.core to requests_oauthlib.oauth1_auth for consistency. #79.\n- Added Facebook compliance fix and access_token_response hook to OAuth2Session. #63.\n- Added LinkedIn compliance fix.\n- Added refresh_token_response compliance hook, invoked before parsing the refresh token.\n- Correctly limit compliance hooks to running only once!\n- Content type guessing should only be done when no content type is given\n- OAuth1 now updates r.headers instead of replacing it with non case insensitive dict\n- Remove last use of Response.content (in OAuth1Session). #44.\n- State param can now be supplied in OAuth2Session.authorize_url\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/95/52/531ef197b426646f26b53815a7d2a67cb7a331ef098bb276db26a68ac49f/requests-oauthlib-1.3.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"ISC License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Kenneth Reitz.\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

Request body differs.\n\nRequest Fragment Identifier Validation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo validate request URL fragment identifier you can use ``matchers.fragment_identifier_matcher``.\nThe matcher takes fragment string (everything after ``#`` sign) as input for comparison:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import requests\n    import responses\n    from responses.matchers import fragment_identifier_matcher\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def run():\n        url = \"http://example.com?ab=xy&zed=qwe#test=1&foo=bar\"\n        responses.get(\n            url,\n            match=[fragment_identifier_matcher(\"test=1&foo=bar\")],\n            body=b\"test\",\n        )\n\n        # two requests to check reversed order of fragment identifier\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://example.com?ab=xy&zed=qwe#test=1&foo=bar\")\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://example.com?zed=qwe&ab=xy#foo=bar&test=1\")\n\n\n    run()\n\nRequest Headers Validation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhen adding responses you can specify matchers to ensure that your code is\nsending the right headers and provide different responses based on the request\nheaders.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import responses\n    import requests\n    from responses import matchers\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_content_type():\n        responses.get(\n            url=\"http://example.com/\",\n            body=\"hello world\",\n            match=[matchers.header_matcher({\"Accept\": \"text/plain\"})],\n        )\n\n        responses.get(\n            url=\"http://example.com/\",\n            json={\"content\": \"hello world\"},\n            match=[matchers.header_matcher({\"Accept\": \"application/json\"})],\n        )\n\n        # request in reverse order to how they were added!\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://example.com/\", headers={\"Accept\": \"application/json\"})\n        assert resp.json() == {\"content\": \"hello world\"}\n\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://example.com/\", headers={\"Accept\": \"text/plain\"})\n        assert resp.text == \"hello world\"\n\nBecause ``requests`` will send several standard headers in addition to what was\nspecified by your code, request headers that are additional to the ones\npassed to the matcher are ignored by default. You can change this behaviour by\npassing ``strict_match=True`` to the matcher to ensure that only the headers\nthat you're expecting are sent and no others. Note that you will probably have\nto use a ``PreparedRequest`` in your code to ensure that ``requests`` doesn't\ninclude any additional headers.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import responses\n    import requests\n    from responses import matchers\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_content_type():\n        responses.get(\n            url=\"http://example.com/\",\n            body=\"hello world\",\n            match=[matchers.header_matcher({\"Accept\": \"text/plain\"}, strict_match=True)],\n        )\n\n        # this will fail because requests adds its own headers\n        with pytest.raises(ConnectionError):\n            requests.get(\"http://example.com/\", headers={\"Accept\": \"text/plain\"})\n\n        # a prepared request where you overwrite the headers before sending will work\n        session = requests.Session()\n        prepped = session.prepare_request(\n            requests.Request(\n                method=\"GET\",\n                url=\"http://example.com/\",\n            )\n        )\n        prepped.headers = {\"Accept\": \"text/plain\"}\n\n        resp = session.send(prepped)\n        assert resp.text == \"hello world\"\n\n\nCreating Custom Matcher\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf your application requires other encodings or different data validation you can build\nyour own matcher that returns ``Tuple[matches: bool, reason: str]``.\nWhere boolean represents ``True`` or ``False`` if the request parameters match and\nthe string is a reason in case of match failure. Your matcher can\nexpect a ``PreparedRequest`` parameter to be provided by ``responses``.\n\nNote, ``PreparedRequest`` is customized and has additional attributes ``params`` and ``req_kwargs``.\n\nResponse Registry\n---------------------------\n\nDefault Registry\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy default, ``responses`` will search all registered ``Response`` objects and\nreturn a match. If only one ``Response`` is registered, the registry is kept unchanged.\nHowever, if multiple matches are found for the same request, then first match is returned and\nremoved from registry.\n\nOrdered Registry\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn some scenarios it is important to preserve the order of the requests and responses.\nYou can use ``registries.OrderedRegistry`` to force all ``Response`` objects to be dependent\non the insertion order and invocation index.\nIn following example we add multiple ``Response`` objects that target the same URL. However,\nyou can see, that status code will depend on the invocation order.\n\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import requests\n\n    import responses\n    from responses.registries import OrderedRegistry\n\n\n    @responses.activate(registry=OrderedRegistry)\n    def test_invocation_index():\n        responses.get(\n            \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\",\n            json={\"msg\": \"not found\"},\n            status=404,\n        )\n        responses.get(\n            \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\",\n            json={\"msg\": \"OK\"},\n            status=200,\n        )\n        responses.get(\n            \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\",\n            json={\"msg\": \"OK\"},\n            status=200,\n        )\n        responses.get(\n            \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\",\n            json={\"msg\": \"not found\"},\n            status=404,\n        )\n\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\")\n        assert resp.status_code == 404\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\")\n        assert resp.status_code == 200\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\")\n        assert resp.status_code == 200\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\")\n        assert resp.status_code == 404\n\n\nCustom Registry\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBuilt-in ``registries`` are suitable for most of use cases, but to handle special conditions, you can\nimplement custom registry which must follow interface of ``registries.FirstMatchRegistry``.\nRedefining the ``find`` method will allow you to create custom search logic and return\nappropriate ``Response``\n\nExample that shows how to set custom registry\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import responses\n    from responses import registries\n\n\n    class CustomRegistry(registries.FirstMatchRegistry):\n        pass\n\n\n    print(\"Before tests:\", responses.mock.get_registry())\n    \"\"\" Before tests: <responses.registries.FirstMatchRegistry object> \"\"\"\n\n\n    # using function decorator\n    @responses.activate(registry=CustomRegistry)\n    def run():\n        print(\"Within test:\", responses.mock.get_registry())\n        \"\"\" Within test: <__main__.CustomRegistry object> \"\"\"\n\n\n    run()\n\n    print(\"After test:\", responses.mock.get_registry())\n    \"\"\" After test: <responses.registries.FirstMatchRegistry object> \"\"\"\n\n    # using context manager\n    with responses.RequestsMock(registry=CustomRegistry) as rsps:\n        print(\"In context manager:\", rsps.get_registry())\n        \"\"\" In context manager: <__main__.CustomRegistry object> \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"After exit from context manager:\", responses.mock.get_registry())\n    \"\"\"\n    After exit from context manager: <responses.registries.FirstMatchRegistry object>\n    \"\"\"\n\nDynamic Responses\n-----------------\n\nYou can utilize callbacks to provide dynamic responses. The callback must return\na tuple of (``status``, ``headers``, ``body``).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import json\n\n    import responses\n    import requests\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_calc_api():\n        def request_callback(request):\n            payload = json.loads(request.body)\n            resp_body = {\"value\": sum(payload[\"numbers\"])}\n            headers = {\"request-id\": \"728d329e-0e86-11e4-a748-0c84dc037c13\"}\n            return (200, headers, json.dumps(resp_body))\n\n        responses.add_callback(\n            responses.POST,\n            \"http://calc.com/sum\",\n            callback=request_callback,\n            content_type=\"application/json\",\n        )\n\n        resp = requests.post(\n            \"http://calc.com/sum\",\n            json.dumps({\"numbers\": [1, 2, 3]}),\n            headers={\"content-type\": \"application/json\"},\n        )\n\n        assert resp.json() == {\"value\": 6}\n\n        assert len(responses.calls) == 1\n        assert responses.calls[0].request.url == \"http://calc.com/sum\"\n        assert responses.calls[0].response.text == '{\"value\": 6}'\n        assert (\n            responses.calls[0].response.headers[\"request-id\"]\n            == \"728d329e-0e86-11e4-a748-0c84dc037c13\"\n        )\n\nYou can also pass a compiled regex to ``add_callback`` to match multiple urls:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import re, json\n\n    from functools import reduce\n\n    import responses\n    import requests\n\n    operators = {\n        \"sum\": lambda x, y: x + y,\n        \"prod\": lambda x, y: x * y,\n        \"pow\": lambda x, y: x**y,\n    }\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_regex_url():\n        def request_callback(request):\n            payload = json.loads(request.body)\n            operator_name = request.path_url[1:]\n\n            operator = operators[operator_name]\n\n            resp_body = {\"value\": reduce(operator, payload[\"numbers\"])}\n            headers = {\"request-id\": \"728d329e-0e86-11e4-a748-0c84dc037c13\"}\n            return (200, headers, json.dumps(resp_body))\n\n        responses.add_callback(\n            responses.POST,\n            re.compile(\"http://calc.com/(sum|prod|pow|unsupported)\"),\n            callback=request_callback,\n            content_type=\"application/json\",\n        )\n\n        resp = requests.post(\n            \"http://calc.com/prod\",\n            json.dumps({\"numbers\": [2, 3, 4]}),\n            headers={\"content-type\": \"application/json\"},\n        )\n        assert resp.json() == {\"value\": 24}\n\n\n    test_regex_url()\n\n\nIf you want to pass extra keyword arguments to the callback function, for example when reusing\na callback function to give a slightly different result, you can use ``functools.partial``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from functools import partial\n\n\n    def request_callback(request, id=None):\n        payload = json.loads(request.body)\n        resp_body = {\"value\": sum(payload[\"numbers\"])}\n        headers = {\"request-id\": id}\n        return (200, headers, json.dumps(resp_body))\n\n\n    responses.add_callback(\n        responses.POST,\n        \"http://calc.com/sum\",\n        callback=partial(request_callback, id=\"728d329e-0e86-11e4-a748-0c84dc037c13\"),\n        content_type=\"application/json\",\n    )\n\n\nIntegration with unit test frameworks\n-------------------------------------\n\nResponses as a ``pytest`` fixture\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    @pytest.fixture\n    def mocked_responses():\n        with responses.RequestsMock() as rsps:\n            yield rsps\n\n\n    def test_api(mocked_responses):\n        mocked_responses.get(\n            \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\",\n            body=\"{}\",\n            status=200,\n            content_type=\"application/json\",\n        )\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\")\n        assert resp.status_code == 200\n\nAdd default responses for each test\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhen run with ``unittest`` tests, this can be used to set up some\ngeneric class-level responses, that may be complemented by each test.\nSimilar interface could be applied in ``pytest`` framework.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    class TestMyApi(unittest.TestCase):\n        def setUp(self):\n            responses.get(\"https://example.com\", body=\"within setup\")\n            #

This can be useful when the order of requests is not\nguaranteed, but you need to check their correctness, for example in multithreaded\napplications.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import concurrent.futures\n    import responses\n    import requests\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_assert_calls_on_resp():\n        rsp1 = responses.patch(\"http://www.foo.bar/1/\", status=200)\n        rsp2 = responses.patch(\"http://www.foo.bar/2/\", status=400)\n        rsp3 = responses.patch(\"http://www.foo.bar/3/\", status=200)\n\n        def update_user(uid, is_active):\n            url = f\"http://www.foo.bar/{uid}/\"\n            response = requests.patch(url, json={\"is_active\": is_active})\n            return response\n\n        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n            future_to_uid = {\n                executor.submit(update_user, uid, is_active): uid\n                for (uid, is_active) in [(\"3\", True), (\"2\", True), (\"1\", False)]\n            }\n            for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_uid):\n                uid = future_to_uid[future]\n                response = future.result()\n                print(f\"{uid} updated with {response.status_code} status code\")\n\n        assert len(responses.calls) == 3  #

create multiple Response objects where first two contain redirect headers\n        rsp1 = responses.Response(\n            responses.GET,\n            \"http://example.com/1\",\n            status=301,\n            headers={\"Location\": \"http://example.com/2\"},\n        )\n        rsp2 = responses.Response(\n            responses.GET,\n            \"http://example.com/2\",\n            status=301,\n            headers={\"Location\": \"http://example.com/3\"},\n        )\n        rsp3 = responses.Response(responses.GET, \"http://example.com/3\", status=200)\n\n        # register above generated Responses in ``response`` module\n        responses.add(rsp1)\n        responses.add(rsp2)\n        responses.add(rsp3)\n\n        # do the first request in order to generate genuine ``requests`` response\n        # this object will contain genuine attributes of the response, like ``history``\n        rsp = requests.get(\"http://example.com/1\")\n        responses.calls.reset()\n\n        # customize exception with ``response`` attribute\n        my_error = requests.ConnectionError(\"custom error\")\n        my_error.response = rsp\n\n        # update body of the 3rd response with Exception, this will be raised during execution\n        rsp3.body = my_error\n\n        with pytest.raises(requests.ConnectionError) as exc_info:\n            requests.get(\"http://example.com/1\")\n\n        assert exc_info.value.args[0] == \"custom error\"\n        assert rsp1.url in exc_info.value.response.history[0].url\n        assert rsp2.url in exc_info.value.response.history[1].url\n\n\nValidate ``Retry`` mechanism\n----------------------------\n\nIf you are using the ``Retry`` features of ``urllib3`` and want to cover scenarios that test your retry limits, you can test those scenarios with ``responses`` as well. The best approach will be to use an `Ordered Registry`_\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import requests\n\n    import responses\n    from responses import registries\n    from urllib3.util import Retry\n\n\n    @responses.activate(registry=registries.OrderedRegistry)\n    def test_max_retries():\n        url = \"https://example.com\"\n        rsp1 = responses.get(url, body=\"Error\", status=500)\n        rsp2 = responses.get(url, body=\"Error\", status=500)\n        rsp3 = responses.get(url, body=\"Error\", status=500)\n        rsp4 = responses.get(url, body=\"OK\", status=200)\n\n        session = requests.Session()\n\n        adapter = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(\n            max_retries=Retry(\n                total=4,\n                backoff_factor=0.1,\n                status_forcelist=[500],\n                method_whitelist=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PATCH\"],\n            )\n        )\n        session.mount(\"https://\", adapter)\n\n        resp = session.get(url)\n\n        assert resp.status_code == 200\n        assert rsp1.call_count == 1\n        assert rsp2.call_count == 1\n        assert rsp3.call_count == 1\n        assert rsp4.call_count == 1\n\n\nUsing a callback to modify the response\n---------------------------------------\n\nIf you use customized processing in ``requests`` via subclassing/mixins, or if you\nhave library tools that interact with ``requests`` at a low level, you may need\nto add extended processing to the mocked Response object to fully simulate the\nenvironment for your tests.  A ``response_callback`` can be used, which will be\nwrapped by the library before being returned to the caller.  The callback\naccepts a ``response`` as it's single argument, and is expected to return a\nsingle ``response`` object.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import responses\n    import requests\n\n\n    def response_callback(resp):\n        resp.callback_processed = True\n        return resp\n\n\n    with responses.RequestsMock(response_callback=response_callback) as m:\n        m.add(responses.GET, \"http://example.com\", body=b\"test\")\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://example.com\")\n        assert resp.text == \"test\"\n        assert hasattr(resp, \"callback_processed\")\n        assert resp.callback_processed is True\n\n\nPassing through real requests\n-----------------------------\n\nIn some cases you may wish to allow for certain requests to pass through responses\nand hit a real server. This can be done with the ``add_passthru`` methods:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import responses\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_my_api():\n        responses.add_passthru(\"https://percy.io\")\n\nThis will allow any requests matching that prefix, that is otherwise not\nregistered as a mock response, to passthru using the standard behavior.\n\nPass through endpoints can be configured with regex patterns if you\nneed to allow an entire domain or path subtree to send requests:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    responses.add_passthru(re.compile(\"https://percy.io/\\\\w+\"))\n\n\nLastly, you can use the ``passthrough`` argument of the ``Response`` object\nto force a response to behave as a pass through.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Enable passthrough for a single response\n    response = Response(\n        responses.GET,\n        \"http://example.com\",\n        body=\"not used\",\n        passthrough=True,\n    )\n    responses.add(response)\n\n    # Use PassthroughResponse\n    response = PassthroughResponse(responses.GET, \"http://example.com\")\n    responses.add(response)\n\nViewing/Modifying registered responses\n--------------------------------------\n\nRegistered responses are available as a public method of the RequestMock\ninstance. It is sometimes useful for debugging purposes to view the stack of\nregistered responses which can be accessed via ``responses.registered()``.\n\nThe ``replace`` function allows a previously registered ``response`` to be\nchanged. The method signature is identical to ``add``. ``response`` s are\nidentified using ``method`` and ``url``. Only the first matched ``response`` is\nreplaced.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import responses\n    import requests\n\n\n    @responses.activate\n    def test_replace():\n        responses.get(\"http://example.org\", json={\"data\": 1})\n        responses.replace(responses.GET, \"http://example.org\", json={\"data\": 2})\n\n        resp = requests.get(\"http://example.org\")\n\n        assert resp.json() == {\"data\": 2}\n\n\nThe ``upsert`` function allows a previously registered ``response`` to be\nchanged like ``replace``. If the response is registered, the ``upsert`` function\nwill registered it like ``add``.\n\n``remove`` takes a ``method`` and ``url`` argument and will remove **all**\nmatched responses from the registered list.\n\nFinally, ``reset`` will reset all registered responses.\n\nCoroutines and Multithreading\n-----------------------------\n\n``responses`` supports both Coroutines and Multithreading out of the box.\nNote, ``responses`` locks threading on ``RequestMock`` object allowing only\nsingle thread to access it.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    async def test_async_calls():\n        @responses.activate\n        async def run():\n            responses.get(\n                \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\",\n                json={\"error\": \"not found\"},\n                status=404,\n            )\n\n            resp = requests.get(\"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\")\n            assert resp.json() == {\"error\": \"not found\"}\n            assert responses.calls[0].request.url == \"http://twitter.com/api/1/foobar\"\n\n        await run()\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nEnvironment Configuration\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nResponses uses several linting and autoformatting utilities, so it's important that when\nsubmitting patches you use the appropriate toolchain:\n\nClone the repository:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    git clone https://github.com/getsentry/responses.git\n\nCreate an environment (e.g. with ``virtualenv``):\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate\n\nConfigure development requirements:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    make develop\n\n\nTests and Code Quality Validation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe easiest way to validate your code is to run tests via ``tox``.\nCurrent ``tox`` configuration runs the same checks that are used in\nGitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.\n\nPlease execute the following command line from the project root to validate\nyour code against:\n\n* Unit tests in all Python versions that are supported by this project\n* Type validation via ``mypy``\n* All ``pre-commit`` hooks\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    tox\n\nAlternatively, you can always run a single test.

It supports\nencryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key\ngeneration according to PKCS#1 version 1.5. It can be used as a Python\nlibrary as well as on the commandline. The code was mostly written by\nSybren A.  Stüvel.\n\nDocumentation can be found at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa). For all changes, check [the changelog](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nDownload and install using:\n\n    pip install rsa\n\nor download it from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/).\n\nThe source code is maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/) and is\nlicensed under the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n## Security\n\nBecause of how Python internally stores numbers, it is very hard (if not impossible) to make a pure-Python program secure against timing attacks. This library is no exception, so use it with care. See https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/ for more info.\n\n## Setup of Development Environment\n\n```\npython3 -m venv .venv\n. ./.venv/bin/activate\npip install poetry\npoetry install\n```\n\n## Publishing a New Release\n\nSince this project is considered critical on the Python Package Index,\ntwo-factor authentication is required. For uploading packages to PyPi, an API\nkey is required; username+password will not work.\n\nFirst, generate an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/. Then,\nuse this token when publishing instead of your username and password.\n\nAs username, use `__token__`.\nAs password, use the token itself, including the `pypi-` prefix.\n\nSee https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken for help using API tokens to publish. This\nis what I have in `~/.pypirc`:\n\n```\n[distutils]\nindex-servers =\n    rsa\n\n# Use `twine upload -r rsa` to upload with this token.\n[rsa]\n  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/\n  username = __token__\n  password = pypi-token\n```\n\n```\n. ./.venv/bin/activate\npip install twine\n\npoetry build\ntwine check dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whl\ntwine upload -r rsa dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whl\n```\n\nThe `pip install twine` is necessary as Python-RSA requires Python >= 3.6, and\nTwine requires at least version 3.7. This means Poetry refuses to add it as\ndependency.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/aa/65/7d973b89c4d2351d7fb232c2e452547ddfa243e93131e7cfa766da627b52/rsa-4.9.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2011 Sybren A.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d.

Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\n\n1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase \"Project Gutenberg\" appears, or with which the phrase \"Project Gutenberg\" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the United States, you’ll have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook.\n\n1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase \"Project Gutenberg\" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\n\n1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder.

You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than \"Plain Vanilla ASCII\" or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original \"Plain Vanilla ASCII\" or other form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\n\n1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\n\n1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided that\n\n    You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, \"Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.\"\n    You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\n    You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work.\n    You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\n\n1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\n\n1.F.\n\n1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain \"Defects,\" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.\n\n1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\n1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.\n\n1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\n\n1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\n\n1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\n\nThe Foundation’s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n[*] This paragraph, after 1.C., is included only for copyrighted works. For those, you must contact the copyright holder before any non-free use or removal of the Project Gutenberg header.","name":"gutenberg-2020"},{"attribution":"Copyright 2008 Google Inc.

If\nyou don't want to read that, here is a short usage:\n\nFrom this directory, start Python and:\n\n``` python\n>>> from sympy import Symbol, cos\n>>> x = Symbol('x')\n>>> e = 1/cos(x)\n>>> print(e.series(x, 0, 10))\n1 + x**2/2 + 5*x**4/24 + 61*x**6/720 + 277*x**8/8064 + O(x**10)\n```\n\nSymPy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the\nclassic python console (or IPython when available) that loads the SymPy\nnamespace and executes some common commands for you.\n\nTo start it, issue:\n\n    $ bin/isympy\n\nfrom this directory, if SymPy is not installed or simply:\n\n    $ isympy\n\nif SymPy is installed.\n\n## Installation\n\nSymPy has a hard dependency on the [mpmath](http://mpmath.org/) library\n(version \\>= 0.19). You should install it first, please refer to the\nmpmath installation guide:\n\n<https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath#1-download--installation>\n\nTo install SymPy using PyPI, run the following command:\n\n    $ pip install sympy\n\nTo install SymPy using Anaconda, run the following command:\n\n    $ conda install -c anaconda sympy\n\nTo install SymPy from GitHub source, first clone SymPy using `git`:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git\n\nThen, in the `sympy` repository that you cloned, simply run:\n\n    $ pip install .\n\nSee <https://docs.sympy.org/dev/install.html> for more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open\nsource. Please read our [Introduction to Contributing](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Introduction-to-contributing)\npage and the [SymPy Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/documentation-style-guide.html). If you\nare new and looking for some way to contribute, a good place to start is\nto look at the issues tagged [Easy to Fix](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Easy+to+Fix%22).\n\nPlease note that all participants in this project are expected to follow\nour Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide\nby its terms. See [CODE\\_OF\\_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Tests\n\nTo execute all tests, run:\n\n    $./setup.py test\n\nin the current directory.\n\nFor the more fine-grained running of tests or doctests, use `bin/test`\nor respectively `bin/doctest`. The master branch is automatically tested\nby GitHub Actions.\n\nTo test pull requests, use\n[sympy-bot](https://github.com/sympy/sympy-bot).\n\n## Regenerate Experimental <span class=\"title-ref\">LaTeX</span> Parser/Lexer\n\nThe parser and lexer were generated with the [ANTLR4](http://antlr4.org)\ntoolchain in `sympy/parsing/latex/_antlr` and checked into the repo.\nPresently, most users should not need to regenerate these files, but\nif you plan to work on this feature, you will need the `antlr4`\ncommand-line tool (and you must ensure that it is in your `PATH`).\nOne way to get it is:\n\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge antlr=4.11.1\n\nAlternatively, follow the instructions on the ANTLR website and download\nthe `antlr-4.11.1-complete.jar`. Then export the `CLASSPATH` as instructed\nand instead of creating `antlr4` as an alias, make it an executable file\nwith the following contents:\n``` bash\n#!/bin/bash\njava -jar /usr/local/lib/antlr-4.11.1-complete.jar \"$@\"\n```\n\nAfter making changes to `sympy/parsing/latex/LaTeX.g4`, run:\n\n    $ ./setup.py antlr\n\n## Clean\n\nTo clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository):\n\n    $ git clean -Xdf\n\nwhich will clear everything ignored by `.gitignore`, and:\n\n    $ git clean -df\n\nto clear all untracked files. You can revert the most recent changes in\ngit with:\n\n    $ git reset --hard\n\nWARNING: The above commands will all clear changes you may have made,\nand you will lose them forever. Be sure to check things with `git\nstatus`, `git diff`, `git clean -Xn`, and `git clean -n` before doing any\nof those.\n\n## Bugs\n\nOur issue tracker is at <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues>. Please\nreport any bugs that you find. Or, even better, fork the repository on\nGitHub and create a pull request. We welcome all changes, big or small,\nand we will help you make the pull request if you are new to git (just\nask on our mailing list or Gitter Channel). If you further have any queries, you can find answers\non Stack Overflow using the [sympy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sympy) tag.\n\n## Brief History\n\nSymPy was started by Ondřej Čertík in 2005, he wrote some code during\nthe summer, then he wrote some more code during summer 2006. In February\n2007, Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fix many things,\ncontributed documentation, and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz\nPaprocki, Brian Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz, and Chris Wu)\nimproved SymPy incredibly during summer 2007 as part of the Google\nSummer of Code. Pearu Peterson joined the development during the summer\n2007 and he has made SymPy much more competitive by rewriting the core\nfrom scratch, which has made it from 10x to 100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos\nhas contributed pretty-printing and other patches. Fredrik Johansson has\nwritten mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n\nSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You\ncan see <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code> for\nfull details. Each year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's\ndevelopment has come from Google Summer of Code students.\n\nIn 2011, Ondřej Čertík stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron\nMeurer, who also started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his\nplace. Ondřej Čertík is still active in the community but is too busy\nwith work and family to play a lead development role.\n\nSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some\npeople have also left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst,\nor online at:\n\n<https://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team>\n\nThe git history goes back to 2007 when development moved from svn to hg.\nTo see the history before that point, look at\n<https://github.com/sympy/sympy-old>.\n\nYou can use git to see the biggest developers. The command:\n\n    $ git shortlog -ns\n\nwill show each developer, sorted by commits to the project. The command:\n\n    $ git shortlog -ns --since=\"1 year\"\n\nwill show the top developers from the last year.\n\n## Citation\n\nTo cite SymPy in publications use\n\n> Meurer A, Smith CP, Paprocki M, Čertík O, Kirpichev SB, Rocklin M,\n> Kumar A, Ivanov S, Moore JK, Singh S, Rathnayake T, Vig S, Granger BE,\n> Muller RP, Bonazzi F, Gupta H, Vats S, Johansson F, Pedregosa F, Curry\n> MJ, Terrel AR, Roučka Š, Saboo A, Fernando I, Kulal S, Cimrman R,\n> Scopatz A.

It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provides additional examples and further outlines details of the architecture and features of SymPy.\n         },\n volume = 3,\n pages = {e103},\n journal = {PeerJ Computer Science},\n issn = {2376-5992},\n url = {https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.103},\n doi = {10.7717/peerj-cs.103}\n}\n```\n\nSymPy is BSD licensed, so you are free to use it whatever you like, be\nit academic, commercial, creating forks or derivatives, as long as you\ncopy the BSD statement if you redistribute it (see the LICENSE file for\ndetails).

A full list of supported file systems\nand file formats by TensorFlow I/O can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/io/api_docs/python/tfio).\n\nThe use of tensorflow-io is straightforward with keras. Below is an example\nto [Get Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) with\nthe data processing aspect replaced by tensorflow-io:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport tensorflow_io as tfio\n\n# Read the MNIST data into the IODataset.\ndataset_url = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/cvdf-datasets/mnist/\"\nd_train = tfio.IODataset.from_mnist(\n    dataset_url + \"train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz\",\n    dataset_url + \"train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz\",\n)\n\n# Shuffle the elements of the dataset.\nd_train = d_train.shuffle(buffer_size=1024)\n\n# By default image data is uint8, so convert to float32 using map().\nd_train = d_train.map(lambda x, y: (tf.image.convert_image_dtype(x, tf.float32), y))\n\n# prepare batches the data just like any other tf.data.Dataset\nd_train = d_train.batch(32)\n\n# Build the model.\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential(\n    [\n        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax),\n    ]\n)\n\n# Compile the model.\nmodel.compile(\n    optimizer=\"adam\", loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"]\n)\n\n# Fit the model.\nmodel.fit(d_train, epochs=5, steps_per_epoch=200)\n```\n\nIn the above [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) example, the URL's\nto access the dataset files are passed directly to the `tfio.IODataset.from_mnist` API call.\nThis is due to the inherent support that `tensorflow-io` provides for `HTTP`/`HTTPS` file system,\nthus eliminating the need for downloading and saving datasets on a local directory.\n\nNOTE: Since `tensorflow-io` is able to detect and uncompress the MNIST dataset automatically if needed,\nwe can pass the URL's for the compressed files (gzip) to the API call as is.\n\nPlease check the official [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/io) for more\ndetailed and interesting usages of the package.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Python Package\n\nThe `tensorflow-io` Python package can be installed with pip directly using:\n```sh\n$ pip install tensorflow-io\n```\n\nPeople who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:\n```sh\n$ pip install tensorflow-io-nightly\n```\n\nTo ensure you have a version of TensorFlow that is compatible with TensorFlow-IO,\nyou can specify the `tensorflow` extra requirement during install:\n\n```\npip install tensorflow-io[tensorflow]\n```\n\nSimilar extras exist for the `tensorflow-gpu`, `tensorflow-cpu` and `tensorflow-rocm`\npackages.\n\n### Docker Images\n\nIn addition to the pip packages, the docker images can be used to quickly get started.\n\nFor stable builds:\n```sh\n$ docker pull tfsigio/tfio:latest\n$ docker run -it --rm --name tfio-latest tfsigio/tfio:latest\n```\n\nFor nightly builds:\n```sh\n$ docker pull tfsigio/tfio:nightly\n$ docker run -it --rm --name tfio-nightly tfsigio/tfio:nightly\n```\n\n### R Package\n\nOnce the `tensorflow-io` Python package has been successfully installed, you\ncan install the development version of the R package from GitHub via the following:\n```r\nif (!require(\"remotes\")) install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"tensorflow/io\", subdir = \"R-package\")\n```\n\n### TensorFlow Version Compatibility\n\nTo ensure compatibility with TensorFlow, it is recommended to install a matching\nversion of TensorFlow I/O according to the table below. You can find the list\nof releases [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/io/releases).\n\n| TensorFlow I/O Version | TensorFlow Compatibility | Release Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0.36.0 | 2.15.x | Feb 02, 2024 |\n| 0.35.0 | 2.14.x | Dec 18, 2023 |\n| 0.34.0 | 2.13.x | Sep 08, 2023 |\n| 0.33.0 | 2.13.x | Aug 01, 2023 |\n| 0.32.0 | 2.12.x | Mar 28, 2023 |\n| 0.31.0 | 2.11.x | Feb 25, 2023 |\n| 0.30.0 | 2.11.x | Jan 20, 2023 |\n| 0.29.0 | 2.11.x | Dec 18, 2022 |\n| 0.28.0 | 2.11.x | Nov 21, 2022 |\n| 0.27.0 | 2.10.x | Sep 08, 2022 |\n| 0.26.0 | 2.9.x | May 17, 2022 |\n| 0.25.0 | 2.8.x | Apr 19, 2022 |\n| 0.24.0 | 2.8.x | Feb 04, 2022 |\n| 0.23.1 | 2.7.x | Dec 15, 2021 |\n| 0.23.0 | 2.7.x | Dec 14, 2021 |\n| 0.22.0 | 2.7.x | Nov 10, 2021 |\n| 0.21.0 | 2.6.x | Sep 12, 2021 |\n| 0.20.0 | 2.6.x | Aug 11, 2021 |\n| 0.19.1 | 2.5.x | Jul 25, 2021 |\n| 0.19.0 | 2.5.x | Jun 25, 2021 |\n| 0.18.0 | 2.5.x | May 13, 2021 |\n| 0.17.1 | 2.4.x | Apr 16, 2021 |\n| 0.17.0 | 2.4.x | Dec 14, 2020 |\n| 0.16.0 | 2.3.x | Oct 23, 2020 |\n| 0.15.0 | 2.3.x | Aug 03, 2020 |\n| 0.14.0 | 2.2.x | Jul 08, 2020 |\n| 0.13.0 | 2.2.x | May 10, 2020 |\n| 0.12.0 | 2.1.x | Feb 28, 2020 |\n| 0.11.0 | 2.1.x | Jan 10, 2020 |\n| 0.10.0 | 2.0.x | Dec 05, 2019 |\n| 0.9.1 | 2.0.x | Nov 15, 2019 |\n| 0.9.0 | 2.0.x | Oct 18, 2019 |\n| 0.8.1 | 1.15.x | Nov 15, 2019 |\n| 0.8.0 | 1.15.x | Oct 17, 2019 |\n| 0.7.2 | 1.14.x | Nov 15, 2019 |\n| 0.7.1 | 1.14.x | Oct 18, 2019 |\n| 0.7.0 | 1.14.x | Jul 14, 2019 |\n| 0.6.0 | 1.13.x | May 29, 2019 |\n| 0.5.0 | 1.13.x | Apr 12, 2019 |\n| 0.4.0 | 1.13.x | Mar 01, 2019 |\n| 0.3.0 | 1.12.0 | Feb 15, 2019 |\n| 0.2.0 | 1.12.0 | Jan 29, 2019 |\n| 0.1.0 | 1.12.0 | Dec 16, 2018 |\n\n\n## Performance Benchmarking\n\nWe use [github-pages](https://tensorflow.github.io/io/dev/bench/) to document the results of API performance benchmarks. The benchmark job is triggered on every commit to `master` branch and\nfacilitates tracking performance w.r.t commits.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTensorflow I/O is a community led open source project. As such, the project\ndepends on public contributions, bug-fixes, and documentation. Please see:\n\n- [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a guide on how to contribute.\n- [development doc](docs/development.md) for instructions on the development environment setup.\n- [tutorials](docs/tutorials) for a list of tutorial notebooks and instructions on how to write one.\n\n### Build Status and CI\n\n| Build | Status |\n| --- | --- |\n| Linux CPU Python 2 | [![Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-py2.svg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-py2.html) |\n| Linux CPU Python 3 | [![Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-py3.svg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-py3.html) |\n| Linux GPU Python 2| [![Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-gpu-py2.svg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-gpu-py2.html) |\n| Linux GPU Python 3| [![Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-gpu-py3.svg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-kokoro-build-badges/io/ubuntu-gpu-py3.html) |\n\nBecause of manylinux2010 requirement, TensorFlow I/O is built with\nUbuntu:16.04 + Developer Toolset 7 (GCC 7.3) on Linux. Configuration\nwith Ubuntu 16.04 with Developer Toolset 7 is not exactly straightforward.\nIf the system have docker installed, then the following command\nwill automatically build manylinux2010 compatible whl package:\n\n```sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nls dist/*\nfor f in dist/*.whl; do\n  docker run -i --rm -v $PWD:/v -w /v --net=host quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64 bash -x -e /v/tools/build/auditwheel repair --plat manylinux2010_x86_64 $f\ndone\nsudo chown -R $(id -nu):$(id -ng) .\nls wheelhouse/*\n```\n\nIt takes some time to build, but once complete, there will be python\n`3.5`, `3.6`, `3.7` compatible whl packages available in `wheelhouse`\ndirectory.\n\nOn macOS, the same command could be used. However, the script expects `python` in shell\nand will only generate a whl package that matches the version of `python` in shell. If\nyou want to build a whl package for a specific python then you have to alias this version\nof python to `python` in shell. See [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)\nAuditwheel step for instructions how to do that.\n\nNote the above command is also the command we use when releasing packages for Linux and macOS.\n\nTensorFlow I/O uses both GitHub Workflows and Google CI (Kokoro) for continuous integration.\nGitHub Workflows is used for macOS build and test. Kokoro is used for Linux build and test.\nAgain, because of the manylinux2010 requirement, on Linux whl packages are always\nbuilt with Ubuntu 16.04 + Developer Toolset 7. Tests are done on a variatiy of systems\nwith different python3 versions to ensure a good coverage:\n\n| Python | Ubuntu 18.04| Ubuntu 20.04 | macOS + osx9 | Windows-2019 |\n| ------- | ----- | ------- | ------- | --------- |\n| 2.7 |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | N/A |\n| 3.7 |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| 3.8 |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |\n\n\nTensorFlow I/O has integrations with many systems and cloud vendors such as\nPrometheus, Apache Kafka, Apache Ignite, Google Cloud PubSub, AWS Kinesis,\nMicrosoft Azure Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS etc.\n\nWe tried our best to test against those systems in our continuous integration\nwhenever possible. Some tests such as Prometheus, Kafka, and Ignite\nare done with live systems, meaning we install Prometheus/Kafka/Ignite on CI machine before\nthe test is run. Some tests such as Kinesis, PubSub, and Azure Storage are done\nthrough official or non-official emulators. Offline tests are also performed whenever\npossible, though systems covered through offine tests may not have the same\nlevel of coverage as live systems or emulators.\n\n\n|  | Live System | Emulator| CI Integration |  Offline |\n| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Apache Kafka | :heavy_check_mark:  | | :heavy_check_mark:| |\n| Apache Ignite |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n| Prometheus |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n| Google PubSub |   | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n| Azure Storage |   | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n| AWS Kinesis |   | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n| Alibaba Cloud OSS |   | | |  :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Google BigTable/BigQuery |   | to be added | | |\n| Elasticsearch (experimental) |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n| MongoDB (experimental) |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |\n\n\nReferences for emulators:\n- Official [PubSub Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators/pubsub/) by Google Cloud for Cloud PubSub.\n- Official [Azurite Emulator](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite) by Azure for Azure Storage.\n- None-official [LocalStack emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) by LocalStack for AWS Kinesis.\n\n\n## Community\n\n* SIG IO [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/io) and mailing list: [io@tensorflow.org](io@tensorflow.org)\n* SIG IO [Monthly Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CB51yJxns5WA4Ylv89D-a5qReiGTC0GYum6DU-9nKGo/edit)\n* Gitter room: [tensorflow/sig-io](https://gitter.im/tensorflow/sig-io)\n\n## Additional Information\n\n* [Streaming Machine Learning with Tiered Storage and Without a Data Lake](https://www.confluent.io/blog/streaming-machine-learning-with-tiered-storage/) - [Kai Waehner](https://github.com/kaiwaehner)\n* [TensorFlow with Apache Arrow Datasets](https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-with-apache-arrow-datasets-cdbcfe80a59f) - [Bryan Cutler](https://github.com/BryanCutler)\n* [How to build a custom Dataset for Tensorflow](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-custom-dataset-for-tensorflow-1fe3967544d8) - [Ivelin Ivanov](https://github.com/ivelin)\n* [TensorFlow on Apache Ignite](https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-on-apache-ignite-99f1fc60efeb) - [Anton Dmitriev](https://github.com/dmitrievanthony)\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE)\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c9/ed/c007d81e1e07767af3cb4da44989db54a863ab993a79142a348daf3493af/tensorflow_io_gcs_filesystem-0.36.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_14_x86_64.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

order of precedence:\n\n1. Calling `colored` or `cprint` with a truthy `no_color` disables colour.\n2. Calling `colored` or `cprint` with a truthy `force_color` forces colour.\n3. Setting the `ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED` environment variable to any value disables colour.\n4. Setting the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) environment variable to any value\n   disables colour.\n5. Setting the [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://force-color.org/) environment variable to any\n   value forces colour.\n6. Setting the `TERM` environment variable to `dumb`, or using such a\n   [dumb terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Character-oriented_terminal),\n   disables colour.\n7. Finally, termcolor will attempt to detect whether the terminal supports colour.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/10/56/d7d66a84f96d804155f6ff2873d065368b25a07222a6fd51c4f24ef6d764/termcolor-2.4.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2008-2011 Volvox Development Team\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Takes\n   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server's CPU.\n - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.\n - Designed for research and production.\n - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It's always possible to get the part of the\n   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.\n - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.\n\n### Installation\n\n#### With pip:\n\n```bash\npip install tokenizers\n```\n\n#### From sources:\n\nTo use this method, you need to have the Rust installed:\n\n```bash\n# Install with:\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nOnce Rust is installed, you can compile doing the following\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers\ncd tokenizers/bindings/python\n\n# Create a virtual env (you can use yours as well)\npython -m venv .env\nsource .env/bin/activate\n\n# Install `tokenizers` in the current virtual env\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Load a pretrained tokenizer from the Hub\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import Tokenizer\n\ntokenizer = Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n```\n\n### Using the provided Tokenizers\n\nWe provide some pre-build tokenizers to cover the most common cases. You can easily load one of\nthese using some `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` files:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import CharBPETokenizer\n\n# Initialize a tokenizer\nvocab = \"./path/to/vocab.json\"\nmerges = \"./path/to/merges.txt\"\ntokenizer = CharBPETokenizer(vocab, merges)\n\n# And then encode:\nencoded = tokenizer.encode(\"I can feel the magic, can you?\")\nprint(encoded.ids)\nprint(encoded.tokens)\n```\n\nAnd you can train them just as simply:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import CharBPETokenizer\n\n# Initialize a tokenizer\ntokenizer = CharBPETokenizer()\n\n# Then train it!\ntokenizer.train([ \"./path/to/files/1.txt\", \"./path/to/files/2.txt\" ])\n\n# Now, let's use it:\nencoded = tokenizer.encode(\"I can feel the magic, can you?\")\n\n# And finally save it somewhere\ntokenizer.save(\"./path/to/directory/my-bpe.tokenizer.json\")\n```\n\n#### Provided Tokenizers\n\n - `CharBPETokenizer`: The original BPE\n - `ByteLevelBPETokenizer`: The byte level version of the BPE\n - `SentencePieceBPETokenizer`: A BPE implementation compatible with the one used by SentencePiece\n - `BertWordPieceTokenizer`: The famous Bert tokenizer, using WordPiece\n\nAll of these can be used and trained as explained above!\n\n### Build your own\n\nWhenever these provided tokenizers don't give you enough freedom, you can build your own tokenizer,\nby putting all the different parts you need together.\nYou can check how we implemented the [provided tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/master/bindings/python/py_src/tokenizers/implementations) and adapt them easily to your own needs.\n\n#### Building a byte-level BPE\n\nHere is an example showing how to build your own byte-level BPE by putting all the different pieces\ntogether, and then saving it to a single file:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, decoders, trainers, processors\n\n# Initialize a tokenizer\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE())\n\n# Customize pre-tokenization and decoding\ntokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel(add_prefix_space=True)\ntokenizer.decoder = decoders.ByteLevel()\ntokenizer.post_processor = processors.ByteLevel(trim_offsets=True)\n\n# And then train\ntrainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(\n    vocab_size=20000,\n    min_frequency=2,\n    initial_alphabet=pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel.alphabet()\n)\ntokenizer.train([\n    \"./path/to/dataset/1.txt\",\n    \"./path/to/dataset/2.txt\",\n    \"./path/to/dataset/3.txt\"\n], trainer=trainer)\n\n# And Save it\ntokenizer.save(\"byte-level-bpe.tokenizer.json\", pretty=True)\n```\n\nNow, when you want to use this tokenizer, this is as simple as:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import Tokenizer\n\ntokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file(\"byte-level-bpe.tokenizer.json\")\n\nencoded = tokenizer.encode(\"I can feel the magic, can you?\")\n```\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c0/44/625db94e91c6196b6574359fa70bfe28e8eabf57a1b894f8f0ec69727fd1/tokenizers-0.15.2.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |\n| [**torch.utils**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |\n\nUsually, PyTorch is used either as:\n\n- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.\n- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.\n\nElaborating Further:\n\n### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library\n\nIf you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).\n\n![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)\n\nPyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the\ncomputation by a huge amount.\n\nWe provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs\nsuch as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.\nAnd they are fast!\n\n### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd\n\nPyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.\n\nMost frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.\nOne has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.\nChanging the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.\n\nWith PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to\nchange the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes\nfrom several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as\n[torch-autograd](https://github.com/twitter/torch-autograd),\n[autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),\n[Chainer](https://chainer.org), etc.\n\nWhile this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.\nYou get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.\n\n![Dynamic graph](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/docs/source/_static/img/dynamic_graph.gif)\n\n### Python First\n\nPyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.\nIt is built to be deeply integrated into Python.\nYou can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) / [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) etc.\nYou can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries\nand use packages such as [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).\nOur goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.\n\n### Imperative Experiences\n\nPyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.\nWhen you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.\nWhen you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.\nThe stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.\nWe hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.\n\n### Fast and Lean\n\nPyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries\nsuch as [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) and NVIDIA ([cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)) to maximize speed.\nAt the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends\nare mature and have been tested for years.\n\nHence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.\n\nThe memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.\nWe've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that\nyour deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.\nThis enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.\n\n### Extensions Without Pain\n\nWriting new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward\nand with minimal abstractions.\n\nYou can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API\n[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).\n\nIf you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.\nNo wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Binaries\nCommands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)\n\n\n#### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms\n\nPython wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1/TX2, Jetson Xavier NX/AGX, and Jetson AGX Orin are provided [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson-version-1-10-now-available/72048) and the L4T container is published [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-pytorch)\n\nThey require JetPack 4.2 and above, and [@dusty-nv](https://github.com/dusty-nv) and [@ptrblck](https://github.com/ptrblck) are maintaining them.\n\n\n### From Source\n\n#### Prerequisites\nIf you are installing from source, you will need:\n- Python 3.8 or later (for Linux, Python 3.8.1+ is needed)\n- A compiler that fully supports C++17, such as clang or gcc (gcc 9.4.0 or newer is required)\n\nWe highly recommend installing an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) environment. You will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.\n\nIf you want to compile with CUDA support, [select a supported version of CUDA from our support matrix](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then install the following:\n- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)\n- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) v7 or above\n- [Compiler](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) compatible with CUDA\n\nNote: You could refer to the [cuDNN Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/pdf/cuDNN-Support-Matrix.pdf) for cuDNN versions with the various supported CUDA, CUDA driver and NVIDIA hardware\n\nIf you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\nIf you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)\n\nIf you want to compile with ROCm support, install\n- [AMD ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/quick_start.html) 4.0 and above installation\n- ROCm is currently supported only for Linux systems.\n\nIf you want to disable ROCm support, export the environment variable `USE_ROCM=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n#### Install Dependencies\n\n**Common**\n\n```bash\nconda install cmake ninja\n# Run this command from the PyTorch directory after cloning the source code using the “Get the PyTorch Source“ section below\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**On Linux**\n\n```bash\nconda install mkl mkl-include\n# CUDA only: Add LAPACK support for the GPU if needed\nconda install -c pytorch magma-cuda110  # or the magma-cuda* that matches your CUDA version from https://anaconda.org/pytorch/repo\n\n# (optional) If using torch.compile with inductor/triton, install the matching version of triton\n# Run from the pytorch directory after cloning\nmake triton\n```\n\n**On MacOS**\n\n```bash\n# Add this package on intel x86 processor machines only\nconda install mkl mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed\nconda install pkg-config libuv\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\n```bash\nconda install mkl mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed.\n# Distributed package support on Windows is a prototype feature and is subject to changes.\nconda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39\n```\n\n#### Get the PyTorch Source\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch\ncd pytorch\n# if you are updating an existing checkout\ngit submodule sync\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n#### Install PyTorch\n**On Linux**\n\nIf you would like to compile PyTorch with [new C++ ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html) enabled, then first run this command:\n```bash\nexport _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1\n```\n\nIf you're compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:\n```bash\n# Only run this if you're compiling for ROCm\npython tools/amd_build/build_amd.py\n```\n\nInstall PyTorch\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n> _Aside:_ If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), you may experience an error caused by the linker:\n>\n> ```plaintext\n> build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/torch/csrc/stub.o: file not recognized: file format not recognized\n> collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n> error: command 'g++' failed with exit status 1\n> ```\n>\n> This is caused by `ld` from the Conda environment shadowing the system `ld`. You should use a newer version of Python that fixes this issue. The recommended Python version is 3.8.1+.\n\n**On macOS**\n\n```bash\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\nChoose Correct Visual Studio Version.\n\nPyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,\nProfessional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools from\nhttps://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. The build tools *do not*\ncome with Visual Studio Code by default.\n\nIf you want to build legacy python code, please refer to [Building on legacy code and CUDA](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-on-legacy-code-and-cuda)\n\n**CPU-only builds**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPU\n\n```cmd\nconda activate\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\nNote on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you'll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIB`. The instruction [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/docs/source/notes/windows.rst#building-from-source) is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.\n\n**CUDA based build**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunching\n\n[NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.\nNVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called \"Nsight Compute\". To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.\nMake sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.\n\nCurrently, VS 2017 / 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 / 2019.\n<br/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.\n\nAdditional libraries such as\n[Magma](https://developer.nvidia.com/magma), [oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN), and [Sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) are often needed. Please refer to the [installation-helper](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/installation-helpers) to install them.\n\nYou can refer to the [build_pytorch.bat](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/build_pytorch.bat) script for some other environment variables configurations\n\n\n```cmd\ncmd\n\n:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,\n:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.\nset CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\\mkl\\include\nset LIB={Your directory}\\mkl\\lib;%LIB%\n\n:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.\n:: \"Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt\" will be run automatically.\n:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.\nset CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27\nset DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1\nfor /f \"usebackq tokens=*\" %i in (`\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer\\vswhere.exe\" -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call \"%i\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%\n\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compiler\nset CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.27.29110\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\cl.exe\n\npython setup.py develop\n\n```\n\n##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)\n\nYou can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing\nthe following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done\nwith such a step.\n\nOn Linux\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\npython setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\nOn macOS\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-\"$(dirname $(which conda))/../\"}\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\n#### Using pre-built images\n\nYou can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest\n```\n\nPlease note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.\nfor multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you\nshould increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.\n\n#### Building the image yourself\n\n**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version > 18.06\n\nThe `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with CUDA 11.1 support and cuDNN v8.\nYou can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it\nunset to use the default.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n# images are tagged as docker.io/${your_docker_username}/pytorch\n```\n\nYou can also pass the `CMAKE_VARS=\"...\"` environment variable to specify additional CMake variables to be passed to CMake during the build.\nSee [setup.py](./setup.py) for the list of available variables.\n\n```bash\nCMAKE_VARS=\"BUILD_CAFFE2=ON BUILD_CAFFE2_OPS=ON\" make -f docker.Makefile\n```\n\n### Building the Documentation\n\nTo build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the\nreadthedocs theme.\n\n```bash\ncd docs/\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nYou can then build the documentation by running `make <format>` from the\n`docs/` folder. Run `make` to get a list of all available output formats.\n\nIf you get a katex error run `npm install katex`.  If it persists, try\n`npm install -g katex`\n\n> Note: if you installed `nodejs` with a different package manager (e.g.,\n`conda`) then `npm` will probably install a version of `katex` that is not\ncompatible with your version of `nodejs` and doc builds will fail.\nA combination of versions that is known to work is `node@6.13.1` and\n`katex@0.13.18`. To install the latter with `npm` you can run\n```npm install -g katex@0.13.18```\n\n### Previous Versions\n\nInstallation instructions and binaries for previous PyTorch versions may be found\non [our website](https://pytorch.org/previous-versions).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThree-pointers to get you started:\n- [Tutorials: get you started with understanding and using PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n- [Examples: easy to understand PyTorch code across all domains](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n- [The API Reference](https://pytorch.org/docs/)\n- [Glossary](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md)\n\n## Resources\n\n* [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)\n* [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n* [PyTorch Examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n* [PyTorch Models](https://pytorch.org/hub/)\n* [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)\n* [Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229)\n* [Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch)\n* [PyTorch Twitter](https://twitter.com/PyTorch)\n* [PyTorch Blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/)\n* [PyTorch YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXI5YeOsh03QvJ59PMaXFw)\n\n## Communication\n* Forums: Discuss implementations, research, etc. https://discuss.pytorch.org\n* GitHub Issues: Bug reports, feature requests, install issues, RFCs, thoughts, etc.\n* Slack: The [PyTorch Slack](https://pytorch.slack.com/) hosts a primary audience of moderate to experienced PyTorch users and developers for general chat, online discussions, collaboration, etc. If you are a beginner looking for help, the primary medium is [PyTorch Forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org).

Simply inserting ``tqdm`` (or ``python -m tqdm``) between pipes will pass\nthrough all ``stdin`` to ``stdout`` while printing progress to ``stderr``.\n\nThe example below demonstrate counting the number of lines in all Python files\nin the current directory, with timing information included.\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ time find . -name '*.py' -type f -exec cat \\{} \\; | wc -l\n    857365\n\n    real    0m3.458s\n    user    0m0.274s\n    sys     0m3.325s\n\n    $ time find . -name '*.py' -type f -exec cat \\{} \\; | tqdm | wc -l\n    857366it [00:03, 246471.31it/s]\n    857365\n\n    real    0m3.585s\n    user    0m0.862s\n    sys     0m3.358s\n\nNote that the usual arguments for ``tqdm`` can also be specified.\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ find . -name '*.py' -type f -exec cat \\{} \\; |\n        tqdm --unit loc --unit_scale --total 857366 >> /dev/null\n    100%|█████████████████████████████████| 857K/857K [00:04<00:00, 246Kloc/s]\n\nBacking up a large directory?\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ tar -zcf - docs/ | tqdm --bytes --total `du -sb docs/ | cut -f1` \\\n      > backup.tgz\n     44%|██████████████▊                   | 153M/352M [00:14<00:18, 11.0MB/s]\n\nThis can be beautified further:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ BYTES=\"$(du -sb docs/ | cut -f1)\"\n    $ tar -cf - docs/ \\\n      | tqdm --bytes --total \"$BYTES\" --desc Processing | gzip \\\n      | tqdm --bytes --total \"$BYTES\" --desc Compressed --position 1 \\\n      > ~/backup.tgz\n    Processing: 100%|██████████████████████| 352M/352M [00:14<00:00, 30.2MB/s]\n    Compressed:  42%|█████████▎            | 148M/352M [00:14<00:19, 10.9MB/s]\n\nOr done on a file level using 7-zip:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ 7z a -bd -r backup.7z docs/ | grep Compressing \\\n      | tqdm --total $(find docs/ -type f | wc -l) --unit files \\\n      | grep -v Compressing\n    100%|██████████████████████████▉| 15327/15327 [01:00<00:00, 712.96files/s]\n\nPre-existing CLI programs already outputting basic progress information will\nbenefit from ``tqdm``'s ``--update`` and ``--update_to`` flags:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    $ seq 3 0.1 5 | tqdm --total 5 --update_to --null\n    100%|████████████████████████████████████| 5.0/5 [00:00<00:00, 9673.21it/s]\n    $ seq 10 | tqdm --update --null  # 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55 iterations\n    55it [00:00, 90006.52it/s]\n\nFAQ and Known Issues\n--------------------\n\n|GitHub-Issues|\n\nThe most common issues relate to excessive output on multiple lines, instead\nof a neat one-line progress bar.\n\n- Consoles in general: require support for carriage return (``CR``, ``\\r``).\n- Nested progress bars:\n\n  * Consoles in general: require support for moving cursors up to the\n    previous line. For example,\n    `IDLE <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/191#issuecomment-230168030>`__,\n    `ConEmu <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/254>`__ and\n    `PyCharm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/203>`__ (also\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/208>`__,\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/307>`__, and\n    `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/454#issuecomment-335416815>`__)\n    lack full support.\n  * Windows: additionally may require the Python module ``colorama``\n    to ensure nested bars stay within their respective lines.\n\n- Unicode:\n\n  * Environments which report that they support unicode will have solid smooth\n    progressbars. The fallback is an ``ascii``-only bar.\n  * Windows consoles often only partially support unicode and thus\n    `often require explicit ascii=True <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/454#issuecomment-335416815>`__\n    (also `here <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/499>`__). This is due to\n    either normal-width unicode characters being incorrectly displayed as\n    \"wide\", or some unicode characters not rendering.\n\n- Wrapping generators:\n\n  * Generator wrapper functions tend to hide the length of iterables.\n    ``tqdm`` does not.\n  * Replace ``tqdm(enumerate(...))`` with ``enumerate(tqdm(...))`` or\n    ``tqdm(enumerate(x), total=len(x), ...)``.\n    The same applies to ``numpy.ndenumerate``.\n  * Replace ``tqdm(zip(a, b))`` with ``zip(tqdm(a), b)`` or even\n    ``zip(tqdm(a), tqdm(b))``.\n  * The same applies to ``itertools``.\n  * Some useful convenience functions can be found under ``tqdm.contrib``.\n\n- `Hanging pipes in python2 <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/359>`__:\n  when using ``tqdm`` on the CLI, you may need to use Python 3.5+ for correct\n  buffering.\n- `No intermediate output in docker-compose <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/771>`__:\n  use ``docker-compose run`` instead of ``docker-compose up`` and ``tty: true``.\n\nIf you come across any other difficulties, browse and file |GitHub-Issues|.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n|Py-Versions| |README-Hits| (Since 19 May 2016)\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class tqdm():\n      \"\"\"\n      Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly\n      like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating\n      progressbar every time a value is requested.\n      \"\"\"\n\n      def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,\n                   file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1,\n                   maxinterval=10.0, miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False,\n                   unit='it', unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False,\n                   smoothing=0.3, bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None,\n                   postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000):\n\nParameters\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* iterable  : iterable, optional  \n    Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.\n    Leave blank to manually manage the updates.\n* desc  : str, optional  \n    Prefix for the progressbar.\n* total  : int or float, optional  \n    The number of expected iterations. If unspecified,\n    len(iterable) is used if possible. If float(\"inf\") or as a last\n    resort, only basic progress statistics are displayed\n    (no ETA, no progressbar).\n    If ``gui`` is True and this parameter needs subsequent updating,\n    specify an initial arbitrary large positive number,\n    e.g. 9e9.\n* leave  : bool, optional  \n    If [default: True], keeps all traces of the progressbar\n    upon termination of iteration.\n    If ``None``, will leave only if ``position`` is ``0``.\n* file  : ``io.TextIOWrapper`` or ``io.StringIO``, optional  \n    Specifies where to output the progress messages\n    (default: sys.stderr). Uses ``file.write(str)`` and ``file.flush()``\n    methods.  For encoding, see ``write_bytes``.\n* ncols  : int, optional  \n    The width of the entire output message. If specified,\n    dynamically resizes the progressbar to stay within this bound.\n    If unspecified, attempts to use environment width. The\n    fallback is a meter width of 10 and no limit for the counter and\n    statistics. If 0, will not print any meter (only stats).\n* mininterval  : float, optional  \n    Minimum progress display update interval [default: 0.1] seconds.\n* maxinterval  : float, optional  \n    Maximum progress display update interval [default: 10] seconds.\n    Automatically adjusts ``miniters`` to correspond to ``mininterval``\n    after long display update lag. Only works if ``dynamic_miniters``\n    or monitor thread is enabled.\n* miniters  : int or float, optional  \n    Minimum progress display update interval, in iterations.\n    If 0 and ``dynamic_miniters``, will automatically adjust to equal\n    ``mininterval`` (more CPU efficient, good for tight loops).\n    If > 0, will skip display of specified number of iterations.\n    Tweak this and ``mininterval`` to get very efficient loops.\n    If your progress is erratic with both fast and slow iterations\n    (network, skipping items, etc) you should set miniters=1.\n* ascii  : bool or str, optional  \n    If unspecified or False, use unicode (smooth blocks) to fill\n    the meter. The fallback is to use ASCII characters \" 123456789#\".\n* disable  : bool, optional  \n    Whether to disable the entire progressbar wrapper\n    [default: False]. If set to None, disable on non-TTY.\n* unit  : str, optional  \n    String that will be used to define the unit of each iteration\n    [default: it].\n* unit_scale  : bool or int or float, optional  \n    If 1 or True, the number of iterations will be reduced/scaled\n    automatically and a metric prefix following the\n    International System of Units standard will be added\n    (kilo, mega, etc.) [default: False]. If any other non-zero\n    number, will scale ``total`` and ``n``.\n* dynamic_ncols  : bool, optional  \n    If set, constantly alters ``ncols`` and ``nrows`` to the\n    environment (allowing for window resizes) [default: False].\n* smoothing  : float, optional  \n    Exponential moving average smoothing factor for speed estimates\n    (ignored in GUI mode). Ranges from 0 (average speed) to 1\n    (current/instantaneous speed) [default: 0.3].\n* bar_format  : str, optional  \n    Specify a custom bar string formatting. May impact performance.\n    [default: '{l_bar}{bar}{r_bar}'], where\n    l_bar='{desc}: {percentage:3.0f}%|' and\n    r_bar='| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}, '\n    '{rate_fmt}{postfix}]'\n    Possible vars: l_bar, bar, r_bar, n, n_fmt, total, total_fmt,\n    percentage, elapsed, elapsed_s, ncols, nrows, desc, unit,\n    rate, rate_fmt, rate_noinv, rate_noinv_fmt,\n    rate_inv, rate_inv_fmt, postfix, unit_divisor,\n    remaining, remaining_s, eta.\n    Note that a trailing \": \" is automatically removed after {desc}\n    if the latter is empty.\n* initial  : int or float, optional  \n    The initial counter value. Useful when restarting a progress\n    bar [default: 0]. If using float, consider specifying ``{n:.3f}``\n    or similar in ``bar_format``, or specifying ``unit_scale``.\n* position  : int, optional  \n    Specify the line offset to print this bar (starting from 0)\n    Automatic if unspecified.\n    Useful to manage multiple bars at once (eg, from threads).\n* postfix  : dict or ``*``, optional  \n    Specify additional stats to display at the end of the bar.\n    Calls ``set_postfix(**postfix)`` if possible (dict).\n* unit_divisor  : float, optional  \n    [default: 1000], ignored unless ``unit_scale`` is True.\n* write_bytes  : bool, optional  \n    If (default: None) and ``file`` is unspecified,\n    bytes will be written in Python 2. If ``True`` will also write\n    bytes. In all other cases will default to unicode.\n* lock_args  : tuple, optional  \n    Passed to ``refresh`` for intermediate output\n    (initialisation, iterating, and updating).\n* nrows  : int, optional  \n    The screen height. If specified, hides nested bars outside this\n    bound. If unspecified, attempts to use environment height.\n    The fallback is 20.\n* colour  : str, optional  \n    Bar colour (e.g. 'green', '#00ff00').\n* delay  : float, optional  \n    Don't display until [default: 0] seconds have elapsed.\n\nExtra CLI Options\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* delim  : chr, optional  \n    Delimiting character [default: '\\n']. Use '\\0' for null.\n    N.B.: on Windows systems, Python converts '\\n' to '\\r\\n'.\n* buf_size  : int, optional  \n    String buffer size in bytes [default: 256]\n    used when ``delim`` is specified.\n* bytes  : bool, optional  \n    If true, will count bytes, ignore ``delim``, and default\n    ``unit_scale`` to True, ``unit_divisor`` to 1024, and ``unit`` to 'B'.\n* tee  : bool, optional  \n    If true, passes ``stdin`` to both ``stderr`` and ``stdout``.\n* update  : bool, optional  \n    If true, will treat input as newly elapsed iterations,\n    i.e. numbers to pass to ``update()``. Note that this is slow\n    (~2e5 it/s) since every input must be decoded as a number.\n* update_to  : bool, optional  \n    If true, will treat input as total elapsed iterations,\n    i.e. numbers to assign to ``self.n``. Note that this is slow\n    (~2e5 it/s) since every input must be decoded as a number.\n* null  : bool, optional  \n    If true, will discard input (no stdout).\n* manpath  : str, optional  \n    Directory in which to install tqdm man pages.\n* comppath  : str, optional  \n    Directory in which to place tqdm completion.\n* log  : str, optional  \n    CRITICAL|FATAL|ERROR|WARN(ING)|[default: 'INFO']|DEBUG|NOTSET.\n\nReturns\n~~~~~~~\n\n* out  : decorated iterator.  \n\n.. code:: python\n\n    class tqdm():\n      def update(self, n=1):\n          \"\"\"\n          Manually update the progress bar, useful for streams\n          such as reading files.\n          E.g.:\n          >>> t = tqdm(total=filesize) # Initialise\n          >>> for current_buffer in stream:\n          ...    ...\n          ...    t.update(len(current_buffer))\n          >>> t.close()\n          The last line is highly recommended, but possibly not necessary if\n          ``t.update()`` will be called in such a way that ``filesize`` will be\n          exactly reached and printed.\n\n          Parameters\n          ----------\n          n  : int or float, optional\n              Increment to add to the internal counter of iterations\n              [default: 1].

To prevent this behaviour, insert an extra item into the dictionary\n  where the key is not a string.\n\nAdditional ``bar_format`` parameters may also be defined by overriding\n``format_dict``, and the bar itself may be modified using ``ascii``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm import tqdm\n    class TqdmExtraFormat(tqdm):\n        \"\"\"Provides a `total_time` format parameter\"\"\"\n        @property\n        def format_dict(self):\n            d = super(TqdmExtraFormat, self).format_dict\n            total_time = d[\"elapsed\"] * (d[\"total\"] or 0) / max(d[\"n\"], 1)\n            d.update(total_time=self.format_interval(total_time) + \" in total\")\n            return d\n\n    for i in TqdmExtraFormat(\n          range(9), ascii=\" .oO0\",\n          bar_format=\"{total_time}: {percentage:.0f}%|{bar}{r_bar}\"):\n        if i == 4:\n            break\n\n.. code::\n\n    00:00 in total: 44%|0000.     | 4/9 [00:00<00:00, 962.93it/s]\n\nNote that ``{bar}`` also supports a format specifier ``[width][type]``.\n\n- ``width``\n\n  * unspecified (default): automatic to fill ``ncols``\n  * ``int >= 0``: fixed width overriding ``ncols`` logic\n  * ``int < 0``: subtract from the automatic default\n\n- ``type``\n\n  * ``a``: ascii (``ascii=True`` override)\n  * ``u``: unicode (``ascii=False`` override)\n  * ``b``: blank (``ascii=\"  \"`` override)\n\nThis means a fixed bar with right-justified text may be created by using:\n``bar_format=\"{l_bar}{bar:10}|{bar:-10b}right-justified\"``\n\nNested progress bars\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``tqdm`` supports nested progress bars. Here's an example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.auto import trange\n    from time import sleep\n\n    for i in trange(4, desc='1st loop'):\n        for j in trange(5, desc='2nd loop'):\n            for k in trange(50, desc='3rd loop', leave=False):\n                sleep(0.01)\n\nFor manual control over positioning (e.g. for multi-processing use),\nyou may specify ``position=n`` where ``n=0`` for the outermost bar,\n``n=1`` for the next, and so on.\nHowever, it's best to check if ``tqdm`` can work without manual ``position``\nfirst.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from time import sleep\n    from tqdm import trange, tqdm\n    from multiprocessing import Pool, RLock, freeze_support\n\n    L = list(range(9))\n\n    def progresser(n):\n        interval = 0.001 / (n + 2)\n        total = 5000\n        text = \"#{}, est. {:<04.2}s\".format(n, interval * total)\n        for _ in trange(total, desc=text, position=n):\n            sleep(interval)\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        freeze_support()  # for Windows support\n        tqdm.set_lock(RLock())  # for managing output contention\n        p = Pool(initializer=tqdm.set_lock, initargs=(tqdm.get_lock(),))\n        p.map(progresser, L)\n\nNote that in Python 3, ``tqdm.write`` is thread-safe:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from time import sleep\n    from tqdm import tqdm, trange\n    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n\n    L = list(range(9))\n\n    def progresser(n):\n        interval = 0.001 / (n + 2)\n        total = 5000\n        text = \"#{}, est. {:<04.2}s\".format(n, interval * total)\n        for _ in trange(total, desc=text):\n            sleep(interval)\n        if n == 6:\n            tqdm.write(\"n == 6 completed.\")\n            tqdm.write(\"`tqdm.write()` is thread-safe in py3!\")\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as p:\n            p.map(progresser, L)\n\nHooks and callbacks\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``tqdm`` can easily support callbacks/hooks and manual updates.\nHere's an example with ``urllib``:\n\n**``urllib.urlretrieve`` documentation**\n\n    | [...]\n    | If present, the hook function will be called once\n    | on establishment of the network connection and once after each block read\n    | thereafter.

If [default: None] remains unchanged.\n            \"\"\"\n            if tsize is not None:\n                self.total = tsize\n            return self.update(b * bsize - self.n)  # also sets self.n = b * bsize\n\n    eg_link = \"https://caspersci.uk.to/matryoshka.zip\"\n    with TqdmUpTo(unit='B', unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1024, miniters=1,\n                  desc=eg_link.split('/')[-1]) as t:  # all optional kwargs\n        urllib.urlretrieve(eg_link, filename=os.devnull,\n                           reporthook=t.update_to, data=None)\n        t.total = t.n\n\nInspired by `twine#242 <https://github.com/pypa/twine/pull/242>`__.\nFunctional alternative in\n`examples/tqdm_wget.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/examples/tqdm_wget.py>`__.\n\nIt is recommend to use ``miniters=1`` whenever there is potentially\nlarge differences in iteration speed (e.g. downloading a file over\na patchy connection).\n\n**Wrapping read/write methods**\n\nTo measure throughput through a file-like object's ``read`` or ``write``\nmethods, use ``CallbackIOWrapper``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.auto import tqdm\n    from tqdm.utils import CallbackIOWrapper\n\n    with tqdm(total=file_obj.size,\n              unit='B', unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1024) as t:\n        fobj = CallbackIOWrapper(t.update, file_obj, \"read\")\n        while True:\n            chunk = fobj.read(chunk_size)\n            if not chunk:\n                break\n        t.reset()\n        # ... continue to use `t` for something else\n\nAlternatively, use the even simpler ``wrapattr`` convenience function,\nwhich would condense both the ``urllib`` and ``CallbackIOWrapper`` examples\ndown to:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import urllib, os\n    from tqdm import tqdm\n\n    eg_link = \"https://caspersci.uk.to/matryoshka.zip\"\n    response = getattr(urllib, 'request', urllib).urlopen(eg_link)\n    with tqdm.wrapattr(open(os.devnull, \"wb\"), \"write\",\n                       miniters=1, desc=eg_link.split('/')[-1],\n                       total=getattr(response, 'length', None)) as fout:\n        for chunk in response:\n            fout.write(chunk)\n\nThe ``requests`` equivalent is nearly identical:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import requests, os\n    from tqdm import tqdm\n\n    eg_link = \"https://caspersci.uk.to/matryoshka.zip\"\n    response = requests.get(eg_link, stream=True)\n    with tqdm.wrapattr(open(os.devnull, \"wb\"), \"write\",\n                       miniters=1, desc=eg_link.split('/')[-1],\n                       total=int(response.headers.get('content-length', 0))) as fout:\n        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=4096):\n            fout.write(chunk)\n\n**Custom callback**\n\n``tqdm`` is known for intelligently skipping unnecessary displays. To make a\ncustom callback take advantage of this, simply use the return value of\n``update()``. This is set to ``True`` if a ``display()`` was triggered.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.auto import tqdm as std_tqdm\n\n    def external_callback(*args, **kwargs):\n        ...\n\n    class TqdmExt(std_tqdm):\n        def update(self, n=1):\n            displayed = super(TqdmExt, self).update(n):\n            if displayed:\n                external_callback(**self.format_dict)\n            return displayed\n\n``asyncio``\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNote that ``break`` isn't currently caught by asynchronous iterators.\nThis means that ``tqdm`` cannot clean up after itself in this case:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.asyncio import tqdm\n\n    async for i in tqdm(range(9)):\n        if i == 2:\n            break\n\nInstead, either call ``pbar.close()`` manually or use the context manager syntax:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.asyncio import tqdm\n\n    with tqdm(range(9)) as pbar:\n        async for i in pbar:\n            if i == 2:\n                break\n\nPandas Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDue to popular demand we've added support for ``pandas`` -- here's an example\nfor ``DataFrame.progress_apply`` and ``DataFrameGroupBy.progress_apply``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    from tqdm import tqdm\n\n    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0, 100, (100000, 6)))\n\n    # Register `pandas.progress_apply` and `pandas.Series.map_apply` with `tqdm`\n    # (can use `tqdm.gui.tqdm`, `tqdm.notebook.tqdm`, optional kwargs, etc.)\n    tqdm.pandas(desc=\"my bar!\")\n\n    # Now you can use `progress_apply` instead of `apply`\n    # and `progress_map` instead of `map`\n    df.progress_apply(lambda x: x**2)\n    # can also groupby:\n    # df.groupby(0).progress_apply(lambda x: x**2)\n\nIn case you're interested in how this works (and how to modify it for your\nown callbacks), see the\n`examples <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/tree/master/examples>`__\nfolder or import the module and run ``help()``.\n\nKeras Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA ``keras`` callback is also available:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.keras import TqdmCallback\n\n    ...\n\n    model.fit(..., verbose=0, callbacks=[TqdmCallback()])\n\nDask Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA ``dask`` callback is also available:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.dask import TqdmCallback\n\n    with TqdmCallback(desc=\"compute\"):\n        ...\n        arr.compute()\n\n    # or use callback globally\n    cb = TqdmCallback(desc=\"global\")\n    cb.register()\n    arr.compute()\n\nIPython/Jupyter Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIPython/Jupyter is supported via the ``tqdm.notebook`` submodule:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.notebook import trange, tqdm\n    from time import sleep\n\n    for i in trange(3, desc='1st loop'):\n        for j in tqdm(range(100), desc='2nd loop'):\n            sleep(0.01)\n\nIn addition to ``tqdm`` features, the submodule provides a native Jupyter\nwidget (compatible with IPython v1-v4 and Jupyter), fully working nested bars\nand colour hints (blue: normal, green: completed, red: error/interrupt,\nlight blue: no ETA); as demonstrated below.\n\n|Screenshot-Jupyter1|\n|Screenshot-Jupyter2|\n|Screenshot-Jupyter3|\n\nThe ``notebook`` version supports percentage or pixels for overall width\n(e.g.: ``ncols='100%'`` or ``ncols='480px'``).\n\nIt is also possible to let ``tqdm`` automatically choose between\nconsole or notebook versions by using the ``autonotebook`` submodule:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.autonotebook import tqdm\n    tqdm.pandas()\n\nNote that this will issue a ``TqdmExperimentalWarning`` if run in a notebook\nsince it is not meant to be possible to distinguish between ``jupyter notebook``\nand ``jupyter console``. Use ``auto`` instead of ``autonotebook`` to suppress\nthis warning.\n\nNote that notebooks will display the bar in the cell where it was created.\nThis may be a different cell from the one where it is used.\nIf this is not desired, either\n\n- delay the creation of the bar to the cell where it must be displayed, or\n- create the bar with ``display=False``, and in a later cell call\n  ``display(bar.container)``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n    pbar = tqdm(..., display=False)\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # different cell\n    display(pbar.container)\n\nThe ``keras`` callback has a ``display()`` method which can be used likewise:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.keras import TqdmCallback\n    cbk = TqdmCallback(display=False)\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # different cell\n    cbk.display()\n    model.fit(..., verbose=0, callbacks=[cbk])\n\nAnother possibility is to have a single bar (near the top of the notebook)\nwhich is constantly re-used (using ``reset()`` rather than ``close()``).\nFor this reason, the notebook version (unlike the CLI version) does not\nautomatically call ``close()`` upon ``Exception``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n    pbar = tqdm()\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # different cell\n    iterable = range(100)\n    pbar.reset(total=len(iterable))  # initialise with new `total`\n    for i in iterable:\n        pbar.update()\n    pbar.refresh()  # force print final status but don't `close()`\n\nCustom Integration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo change the default arguments (such as making ``dynamic_ncols=True``),\nsimply use built-in Python magic:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from functools import partial\n    from tqdm import tqdm as std_tqdm\n    tqdm = partial(std_tqdm, dynamic_ncols=True)\n\nFor further customisation,\n``tqdm`` may be inherited from to create custom callbacks (as with the\n``TqdmUpTo`` example `above <#hooks-and-callbacks>`__) or for custom frontends\n(e.g. GUIs such as notebook or plotting packages). In the latter case:\n\n1. ``def __init__()`` to call ``super().__init__(..., gui=True)`` to disable\n   terminal ``status_printer`` creation.\n2. Redefine: ``close()``, ``clear()``, ``display()``.\n\nConsider overloading ``display()`` to use e.g.\n``self.frontend(**self.format_dict)`` instead of ``self.sp(repr(self))``.\n\nSome submodule examples of inheritance:\n\n- `tqdm/notebook.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/notebook.py>`__\n- `tqdm/gui.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/gui.py>`__\n- `tqdm/tk.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/tk.py>`__\n- `tqdm/contrib/telegram.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/telegram.py>`__\n- `tqdm/contrib/discord.py <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/contrib/discord.py>`__\n\nDynamic Monitor/Meter\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can use a ``tqdm`` as a meter which is not monotonically increasing.\nThis could be because ``n`` decreases (e.g. a CPU usage monitor) or ``total``\nchanges.\n\nOne example would be recursively searching for files. The ``total`` is the\nnumber of objects found so far, while ``n`` is the number of those objects which\nare files (rather than folders):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm import tqdm\n    import os.path\n\n    def find_files_recursively(path, show_progress=True):\n        files = []\n        # total=1 assumes `path` is a file\n        t = tqdm(total=1, unit=\"file\", disable=not show_progress)\n        if not os.path.exists(path):\n            raise IOError(\"Cannot find:\" + path)\n\n        def append_found_file(f):\n            files.append(f)\n            t.update()\n\n        def list_found_dir(path):\n            \"\"\"returns os.listdir(path) assuming os.path.isdir(path)\"\"\"\n            listing = os.listdir(path)\n            # subtract 1 since a \"file\" we found was actually this directory\n            t.total += len(listing) - 1\n            # fancy way to give info without forcing a refresh\n            t.set_postfix(dir=path[-10:], refresh=False)\n            t.update(0)  # may trigger a refresh\n            return listing\n\n        def recursively_search(path):\n            if os.path.isdir(path):\n                for f in list_found_dir(path):\n                    recursively_search(os.path.join(path, f))\n            else:\n                append_found_file(path)\n\n        recursively_search(path)\n        t.set_postfix(dir=path)\n        t.close()\n        return files\n\nUsing ``update(0)`` is a handy way to let ``tqdm`` decide when to trigger a\ndisplay refresh to avoid console spamming.\n\nWriting messages\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is a work in progress (see\n`#737 <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/737>`__).\n\nSince ``tqdm`` uses a simple printing mechanism to display progress bars,\nyou should not write any message in the terminal using ``print()`` while\na progressbar is open.\n\nTo write messages in the terminal without any collision with ``tqdm`` bar\ndisplay, a ``.write()`` method is provided:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from tqdm.auto import tqdm, trange\n    from time import sleep\n\n    bar = trange(10)\n    for i in bar:\n        # Print using tqdm class method .write()\n        sleep(0.1)\n        if not (i % 3):\n            tqdm.write(\"Done task %i\" % i)\n        # Can also use bar.write()\n\nBy default, this will print to standard output ``sys.stdout``. but you can\nspecify any file-like object using the ``file`` argument. For example, this\ncan be used to redirect the messages writing to a log file or class.\n\nRedirecting writing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf using a library that can print messages to the console, editing the library\nby  replacing ``print()`` with ``tqdm.write()`` may not be desirable.\nIn that case, redirecting ``sys.stdout`` to ``tqdm.write()`` is an option.\n\nTo redirect ``sys.stdout``, create a file-like class that will write\nany input string to ``tqdm.write()``, and supply the arguments\n``file=sys.stdout, dynamic_ncols=True``.\n\nA reusable canonical example is given below:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from time import sleep\n    import contextlib\n    import sys\n    from tqdm import tqdm\n    from tqdm.contrib import DummyTqdmFile\n\n\n    @contextlib.contextmanager\n    def std_out_err_redirect_tqdm():\n        orig_out_err = sys.stdout, sys.stderr\n        try:\n            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = map(DummyTqdmFile, orig_out_err)\n            yield orig_out_err[0]\n        # Relay exceptions\n        except Exception as exc:\n            raise exc\n        # Always restore sys.stdout/err if necessary\n        finally:\n            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = orig_out_err\n\n    def some_fun(i):\n        print(\"Fee, fi, fo,\".split()[i])\n\n    # Redirect stdout to tqdm.write() (don't forget the `as save_stdout`)\n    with std_out_err_redirect_tqdm() as orig_stdout:\n        # tqdm needs the original stdout\n        # and dynamic_ncols=True to autodetect console width\n        for i in tqdm(range(3), file=orig_stdout, dynamic_ncols=True):\n            sleep(.5)\n            some_fun(i)\n\n    # After the `with`, printing is restored\n    print(\"Done!\")\n\nRedirecting ``logging``\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSimilar to ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` as detailed above, console ``logging``\nmay also be redirected to ``tqdm.write()``.\n\nWarning: if also redirecting ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr``, make sure to\nredirect ``logging`` first if needed.\n\nHelper methods are available in ``tqdm.contrib.logging``. For example:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import logging\n    from tqdm import trange\n    from tqdm.contrib.logging import logging_redirect_tqdm\n\n    LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n        with logging_redirect_tqdm():\n            for i in trange(9):\n                if i == 4:\n                    LOG.info(\"console logging redirected to `tqdm.write()`\")\n        # logging restored\n\nMonitoring thread, intervals and miniters\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n``tqdm`` implements a few tricks to increase efficiency and reduce overhead.\n\n- Avoid unnecessary frequent bar refreshing: ``mininterval`` defines how long\n  to wait between each refresh. ``tqdm`` always gets updated in the background,\n  but it will display only every ``mininterval``.\n- Reduce number of calls to check system clock/time.\n- ``mininterval`` is more intuitive to configure than ``miniters``.\n  A clever adjustment system ``dynamic_miniters`` will automatically adjust\n  ``miniters`` to the amount of iterations that fit into time ``mininterval``.\n  Essentially, ``tqdm`` will check if it's time to print without actually\n  checking time. This behaviour can be still be bypassed by manually setting\n  ``miniters``.\n\nHowever, consider a case with a combination of fast and slow iterations.\nAfter a few fast iterations, ``dynamic_miniters`` will set ``miniters`` to a\nlarge number. When iteration rate subsequently slows, ``miniters`` will\nremain large and thus reduce display update frequency. To address this:\n\n- ``maxinterval`` defines the maximum time between display refreshes.\n  A concurrent monitoring thread checks for overdue updates and forces one\n  where necessary.\n\nThe monitoring thread should not have a noticeable overhead, and guarantees\nupdates at least every 10 seconds by default.\nThis value can be directly changed by setting the ``monitor_interval`` of\nany ``tqdm`` instance (i.e. ``t = tqdm.tqdm(...); t.monitor_interval = 2``).\nThe monitor thread may be disabled application-wide by setting\n``tqdm.tqdm.monitor_interval = 0`` before instantiation of any ``tqdm`` bar.\n\n\nMerch\n-----\n\nYou can buy `tqdm branded merch <https://tqdm.github.io/merch>`__ now!\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\n|GitHub-Commits| |GitHub-Issues| |GitHub-PRs|

License Grants and Conditions\n      2.1. Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.\n\n🤗 Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) — with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.\n\n## Online demos\n\nYou can test most of our models directly on their pages from the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). We also offer [private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API](https://huggingface.co/pricing) for public and private models.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nIn Natural Language Processing:\n-

of projects built around it and the\nHugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone\nelse to build their dream projects.\n\nIn order to celebrate the 100,000 stars of transformers, we have decided to put the spotlight on the\ncommunity, and we have created the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100\nincredible projects built in the vicinity of transformers.\n\nIf you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!\n\n## If you are looking for custom support from the Hugging Face team\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/support\">\n    <img alt=\"HuggingFace Expert Acceleration Program\" src=\"https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/marketing/transformers/new-support-improved.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">\n</a><br>\n\n## Quick tour\n\nTo immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\n>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n>>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.')\n[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996980428695679}]\n```\n\nThe second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here, the answer is \"positive\" with a confidence of 99.97%.\n\nMany tasks have a pre-trained `pipeline` ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image:\n\n``` python\n>>> import requests\n>>> from PIL import Image\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n# Download an image with cute cats\n>>> url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\"\n>>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw\n>>> image = Image.open(image_data)\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for object detection\n>>> object_detector = pipeline('object-detection')\n>>> object_detector(image)\n[{'score': 0.9982201457023621,\n  'label': 'remote',\n  'box': {'xmin': 40, 'ymin': 70, 'xmax': 175, 'ymax': 117}},\n {'score': 0.9960021376609802,\n  'label': 'remote',\n  'box': {'xmin': 333, 'ymin': 72, 'xmax': 368, 'ymax': 187}},\n {'score': 0.9954745173454285,\n  'label': 'couch',\n  'box': {'xmin': 0, 'ymin': 1, 'xmax': 639, 'ymax': 473}},\n {'score': 0.9988006353378296,\n  'label': 'cat',\n  'box': {'xmin': 13, 'ymin': 52, 'xmax': 314, 'ymax': 470}},\n {'score': 0.9986783862113953,\n  'label': 'cat',\n  'box': {'xmin': 345, 'ymin': 23, 'xmax': 640, 'ymax': 368}}]\n```\n\nHere, we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score. Here is the original image on the left, with the predictions displayed on the right:\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n    <a><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\n    <a><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample_post_processed.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\n</h3>\n\nYou can learn more about the tasks supported by the `pipeline` API in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/task_summary).\n\nIn addition to `pipeline`, to download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, all it takes is three lines of code. Here is the PyTorch version:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google-bert/bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"google-bert/bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\n```\n\nAnd here is the equivalent code for TensorFlow:\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google-bert/bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"google-bert/bert-base-uncased\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"tf\")\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\n```\n\nThe tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.\n\nThe model itself is a regular [Pytorch `nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) or a [TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. [This tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our `Trainer` API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset.\n\n## Why should I use transformers?\n\n1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n    - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks.\n    - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.\n    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\n    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.\n\n1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n    - Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.\n    - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.\n    - Dozens of architectures with over 400,000 pretrained models across all modalities.\n\n1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:\n    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\n    - Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will.\n    - Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production.\n\n1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:\n    - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.\n    - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.\n    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\n\n## Why shouldn't I use transformers?\n\n- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.\n- The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate)).\n- While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our [examples folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the-box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.\n\n## Installation\n\n### With pip\n\nThis repository is tested on Python 3.8+, Flax 0.4.1+, PyTorch 1.11+, and TensorFlow 2.6+.\n\nYou should install 🤗 Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\n\nFirst, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it.\n\nThen, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.\nPlease refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) and/or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax#quick-install) and [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) installation pages regarding the specific installation command for your platform.\n\nWhen one of those backends has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers\n```\n\nIf you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you must [install the library from source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#installing-from-source).\n\n### With conda\n\n🤗 Transformers can be installed using conda as follows:\n\n```shell script\nconda install conda-forge::transformers\n```\n\n> **_NOTE:_** Installing `transformers` from the `huggingface` channel is deprecated.\n\nFollow the installation pages of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow to see how to install them with conda.\n\n> **_NOTE:_**  On Windows, you may be prompted to activate Developer Mode in order to benefit from caching.

For example,\n  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous Python versions to use it too.\n- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\n`typing_extensions` is treated specially by static type checkers such as\nmypy and pyright. Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\n\n`typing_extensions` uses\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\nTherefore, it's safe to depend\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\n\n## Included items\n\nSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\ncomplete listing of module contents.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/16/3a/0d26ce356c7465a19c9ea8814b960f8a36c3b0d07c323176620b7b483e44/typing_extensions-4.10.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"1.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Much of the\nPython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.\nurllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python\nstandard libraries:\n\n- Thread safety.\n- Connection pooling.\n- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.\n- File uploads with multipart encoding.\n- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.\n- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.\n- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.\n- 100% test coverage.\n\nurllib3 is powerful and easy to use:\n\n```python3\n>>> import urllib3\n>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")\n>>> resp.status\n200\n>>> resp.data\nb\"User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install urllib3\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git\n$ cd urllib3\n$ pip install .\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nurllib3 has usage and reference documentation at [urllib3.readthedocs.io](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io).\n\n\n## Community\n\nurllib3 has a [community Discord channel](https://discord.gg/urllib3) for asking questions and\ncollaborating with other contributors. Drop by and say hello 👋\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nurllib3 happily accepts contributions. Please see our\n[contributing documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\nfor some tips on getting started.\n\n\n## Security Disclosures\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with maintainers.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@sethmlarson](https://github.com/sethmlarson) (Seth M.

Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"}],"package":"urllib3","projectUrl":"https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/2.2.1/","source":"pip","title":"urllib3","version":"2.2.1"},{"authors":[],"dependencyPaths":["tensorflow > tensorboard > werkzeug > Werkzeug"],"description":"Werkzeug\n========\n\n*werkzeug* German noun: \"tool\".

It therefore goes\nway beyond existing mechanisms such as ``functools.wraps()`` to ensure that\ndecorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities\netc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in\nfar more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and\nconsistent behaviour.\n\nTo ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module\nis used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a\npure Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not\nhave a compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFor further information on the **wrapt** module see:\n\n* http://wrapt.readthedocs.org/\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nTo implement your decorator you need to first define a wrapper function.\nThis will be called each time a decorated function is called. The wrapper\nfunction needs to take four positional arguments:\n\n* ``wrapped`` - The wrapped function which in turns needs to be called by your wrapper function.\n* ``instance`` - The object to which the wrapped function was bound when it was called.\n* ``args`` - The list of positional arguments supplied when the decorated function was called.\n* ``kwargs`` - The dictionary of keyword arguments supplied when the decorated function was called.\n\nThe wrapper function would do whatever it needs to, but would usually in\nturn call the wrapped function that is passed in via the ``wrapped``\nargument.\n\nThe decorator ``@wrapt.decorator`` then needs to be applied to the wrapper\nfunction to convert it into a decorator which can in turn be applied to\nother functions.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import wrapt\n    \n    @wrapt.decorator\n    def pass_through(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\n        return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    @pass_through\n    def function():\n        pass\n\nIf you wish to implement a decorator which accepts arguments, then wrap the\ndefinition of the decorator in a function closure. Any arguments supplied\nto the outer function when the decorator is applied, will be available to\nthe inner wrapper when the wrapped function is called.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import wrapt\n\n    def with_arguments(myarg1, myarg2):\n        @wrapt.decorator\n        def wrapper(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\n            return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n\n    @with_arguments(1, 2)\n    def function():\n        pass\n\nWhen applied to a normal function or static method, the wrapper function\nwhen called will be passed ``None`` as the ``instance`` argument.\n\nWhen applied to an instance method, the wrapper function when called will\nbe passed the instance of the class the method is being called on as the\n``instance`` argument. This will be the case even when the instance method\nwas called explicitly via the class and the instance passed as the first\nargument. That is, the instance will never be passed as part of ``args``.\n\nWhen applied to a class method, the wrapper function when called will be\npassed the class type as the ``instance`` argument.\n\nWhen applied to a class, the wrapper function when called will be passed\n``None`` as the ``instance`` argument. The ``wrapped`` argument in this\ncase will be the class.\n\nThe above rules can be summarised with the following example.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import inspect\n    \n    @wrapt.decorator\n    def universal(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\n        if instance is None:\n            if inspect.isclass(wrapped):\n                # Decorator was applied to a class.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n            else:\n                # Decorator was applied to a function or staticmethod.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n        else:\n            if inspect.isclass(instance):\n                # Decorator was applied to a classmethod.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n            else:\n                # Decorator was applied to an instancemethod.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n\nUsing these checks it is therefore possible to create a universal decorator\nthat can be applied in all situations. It is no longer necessary to create\ndifferent variants of decorators for normal functions and instance methods,\nor use additional wrappers to convert a function decorator into one that\nwill work for instance methods.\n\nIn all cases, the wrapped function passed to the wrapper function is called\nin the same way, with ``args`` and ``kwargs`` being passed. The\n``instance`` argument doesn't need to be used in calling the wrapped\nfunction.\n\nRepository\n----------\n\nFull source code for the **wrapt** module, including documentation files\nand unit tests, can be obtained from github.\n\n* https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt\n\n.. |Actions| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/Test/develop?logo=github&cacheSeconds=600\n   :target: https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/actions\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wrapt.svg?logo=python&cacheSeconds=3600\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wrapt\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/11/eb/e06e77394d6cf09977d92bff310cb0392930c08a338f99af6066a5a98f92/wrapt-1.14.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2013-2022, Graham Dumpleton\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

Although unsigned integer overflow is\ndefined behavior, it's better not to make it happen:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> xxhash.xxh32('I want an unsigned 32-bit seed!', seed=0).hexdigest()\n    'f7a35af8'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh32('I want an unsigned 32-bit seed!', seed=2**32).hexdigest()\n    'f7a35af8'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh32('I want an unsigned 32-bit seed!', seed=1).hexdigest()\n    'd8d4b4ba'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh32('I want an unsigned 32-bit seed!', seed=2**32+1).hexdigest()\n    'd8d4b4ba'\n    >>>\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('I want an unsigned 64-bit seed!', seed=0).hexdigest()\n    'd4cb0a70a2b8c7c1'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('I want an unsigned 64-bit seed!', seed=2**64).hexdigest()\n    'd4cb0a70a2b8c7c1'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('I want an unsigned 64-bit seed!', seed=1).hexdigest()\n    'ce5087f12470d961'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('I want an unsigned 64-bit seed!', seed=2**64+1).hexdigest()\n    'ce5087f12470d961'\n\n\n``digest()`` returns bytes of the **big-endian** representation of the integer\ndigest:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import xxhash\n    >>> h = xxhash.xxh64()\n    >>> h.digest()\n    b'\\xefF\\xdb7Q\\xd8\\xe9\\x99'\n    >>> h.intdigest().to_bytes(8, 'big')\n    b'\\xefF\\xdb7Q\\xd8\\xe9\\x99'\n    >>> h.hexdigest()\n    'ef46db3751d8e999'\n    >>> format(h.intdigest(), '016x')\n    'ef46db3751d8e999'\n    >>> h.intdigest()\n    17241709254077376921\n    >>> int(h.hexdigest(), 16)\n    17241709254077376921\n\nBesides xxh32/xxh64 mentioned above, oneshot functions are also provided,\nso we can avoid allocating XXH32/64 state on heap:\n\n    | xxh32_digest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh32_intdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh32_hexdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh64_digest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh64_intdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh64_hexdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import xxhash\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('a').digest() == xxhash.xxh64_digest('a')\n    True\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('a').intdigest() == xxhash.xxh64_intdigest('a')\n    True\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64('a').hexdigest() == xxhash.xxh64_hexdigest('a')\n    True\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64_hexdigest('xxhash', seed=20141025)\n    'b559b98d844e0635'\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64_intdigest('xxhash', seed=20141025)\n    13067679811253438005L\n    >>> xxhash.xxh64_digest('xxhash', seed=20141025)\n    '\\xb5Y\\xb9\\x8d\\x84N\\x065'\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    In [1]: import xxhash\n\n    In [2]: %timeit xxhash.xxh64_hexdigest('xxhash')\n    268 ns ± 24.1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\n\n    In [3]: %timeit xxhash.xxh64('xxhash').hexdigest()\n    416 ns ± 17.3 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\n\n\nXXH3 hashes are available since v2.0.0 (xxHash v0.8.0), they are:\n\nStreaming classes:\n\n    | xxh3_64\n    | xxh3_128\n\nOneshot functions:\n\n    | xxh3_64_digest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh3_64_intdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh3_64_hexdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh3_128_digest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh3_128_intdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n    | xxh3_128_hexdigest(bytes, seed=0)\n\nAnd aliases:\n\n    | xxh128 = xxh3_128\n    | xxh128_digest = xxh3_128_digest\n    | xxh128_intdigest = xxh3_128_intdigest\n    | xxh128_hexdigest = xxh3_128_hexdigest\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nSEED OVERFLOW\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nxxh32 takes an unsigned 32-bit integer as seed, and xxh64 takes\nan unsigned 64-bit integer as seed.

If you want to install\n``yarl`` on another operating system (like *Alpine Linux*, which is not\nmanylinux-compliant because of the missing glibc and therefore, cannot be\nused with our wheels) the the tarball will be used to compile the library from\nthe source code. It requires a C compiler and and Python headers installed.\n\nTo skip the compilation you must explicitly opt-in by using a PEP 517\nconfiguration setting ``pure-python``, or setting the ``YARL_NO_EXTENSIONS``\nenvironment variable to a non-empty value, e.g.:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ pip install yarl --config-settings=pure-python=false\n\nPlease note that the pure-Python (uncompiled) version is much slower. However,\nPyPy always uses a pure-Python implementation, and, as such, it is unaffected\nby this variable.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nYARL requires multidict_ library.\n\n\nAPI documentation\n------------------\n\nThe documentation is located at https://yarl.aio-libs.org.\n\n\nWhy isn't boolean supported by the URL query API?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is no standard for boolean representation of boolean values.\n\nSome systems prefer ``true``/``false``, others like ``yes``/``no``, ``on``/``off``,\n``Y``/``N``, ``1``/``0``, etc.\n\n``yarl`` cannot make an unambiguous decision on how to serialize ``bool`` values because\nit is specific to how the end-user's application is built and would be different for\ndifferent apps.  The library doesn't accept booleans in the API; a user should convert\nbools into strings using own preferred translation protocol.\n\n\nComparison with other URL libraries\n------------------------------------\n\n* furl (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/furl)\n\n  The library has rich functionality but the ``furl`` object is mutable.\n\n  I'm afraid to pass this object into foreign code: who knows if the\n  code will modify my url in a terrible way while I just want to send URL\n  with handy helpers for accessing URL properties.\n\n  ``furl`` has other non-obvious tricky things but the main objection\n  is mutability.\n\n* URLObject (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/URLObject)\n\n  URLObject is immutable, that's pretty good.\n\n  Every URL change generates a new URL object.\n\n  But the library doesn't do any decode/encode transformations leaving the\n  end user to cope with these gory details.\n\n\nSource code\n-----------\n\nThe project is hosted on GitHub_\n\nPlease file an issue on the `bug tracker\n<https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues>`_ if you have found a bug\nor have some suggestion in order to improve the library.\n\nThe library uses `Azure Pipelines <https://dev.azure.com/aio-libs/yarl>`_ for\nContinuous Integration.\n\nDiscussion list\n---------------\n\n*aio-libs* google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aio-libs\n\nFeel free to post your questions and ideas here.\n\n\nAuthors and License\n-------------------\n\nThe ``yarl`` package is written by Andrew Svetlov.\n\nIt's *Apache 2* licensed and freely available.\n\n\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl\n\n.. _multidict: https://github.com/aio-libs/multidict\n\n..\n    You should *NOT* be adding new change log entries to this file, this\n    file is managed by towncrier.

(`#883 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/883>`__)\n\n\nPackaging updates and notes for downstreams\n-------------------------------------------\n\n- The leading ``--`` has been dropped from the `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ in-tree build\n  backend config setting names. ``--pure-python`` is now just ``pure-python``\n  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  The usage now looks as follows:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python -m build \\\n          --config-setting=pure-python=true \\\n          --config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true\n\n  (`#963 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/963>`__)\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- A step-by-step ``Release Guide`` guide has\n  been added, describing how to release *yarl* -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  This is primarily targeting maintainers. (`#960 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/960>`__)\n- Coverage collection has been implemented for the Cython modules\n  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  It will also be reported to Codecov from any non-release CI jobs.\n\n  To measure coverage in a development environment, *yarl* can be\n  installed in editable mode, which requires an environment variable\n  ``YARL_CYTHON_TRACING=1`` to be set:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ YARL_CYTHON_TRACING=1 python -Im pip install -e .\n\n  Editable install produces C-files required for the Cython coverage\n  plugin to map the measurements back to the PYX-files. (`#961 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/961>`__)\n- It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds using the\n  ``with-cython-tracing`` `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting\n  -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  This can be used in CI and development environment to measure coverage\n  on Cython modules, but is not normally useful to the end-users or\n  downstream packagers.\n\n  Here's a usage example:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python -Im pip install . --config-settings=with-cython-tracing=true\n\n  For editable installs, this setting is on by default. Otherwise, it's\n  off unless requested explicitly. (`#962 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/962>`__)\n\n\n1.9.3 (2023-11-20)\n==================\n\nBug fixes\n---------\n\n- Stopped dropping trailing slashes in ``yarl.URL.joinpath()`` -- by `@gmacon <https://github.com/sponsors/gmacon>`__. (`#862 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/862>`__, `#866 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/866>`__)\n- Started accepting string subclasses in ``__truediv__()`` operations (``URL / segment``) -- by `@mjpieters <https://github.com/sponsors/mjpieters>`__. (`#871 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/871>`__, `#884 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/884>`__)\n- Fixed the human representation of URLs with square brackets in usernames and passwords -- by `@mjpieters <https://github.com/sponsors/mjpieters>`__. (`#876 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/876>`__, `#882 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/882>`__)\n- Updated type hints to include ``URL.missing_port()``, ``URL.__bytes__()``\n  and the ``encoding`` argument to ``yarl.URL.joinpath()``\n  -- by `@mjpieters <https://github.com/sponsors/mjpieters>`__. (`#891 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/891>`__)\n\n\nPackaging updates and notes for downstreams\n-------------------------------------------\n\n- Integrated Cython 3 to enable building *yarl* under Python 3.12 -- by `@mjpieters <https://github.com/sponsors/mjpieters>`__. (`#829 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/829>`__, `#881 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/881>`__)\n- Declared modern ``setuptools.build_meta`` as the `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ build\n  backend in ``pyproject.toml`` explicitly -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__. (`#886 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/886>`__)\n- Converted most of the packaging setup into a declarative ``setup.cfg``\n  config -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__. (`#890 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/890>`__)\n- The packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned ``setup.py`` to an\n  in-tree `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ build backend -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  Whenever the end-users or downstream packagers need to build ``yarl`` from\n  source (a Git checkout or an sdist), they may pass a ``config_settings``\n  flag ``--pure-python``. If this flag is not set, a C-extension will be built\n  and included into the distribution.\n\n  Here is how this can be done with ``pip``:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python -m pip install . --config-settings=--pure-python=false\n\n  This will also work with ``-e | --editable``.\n\n  The same can be achieved via ``pypa/build``:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      $ python -m build --config-setting=--pure-python=false\n\n  Adding ``-w | --wheel`` can force ``pypa/build`` produce a wheel from source\n  directly, as opposed to building an ``sdist`` and then building from it. (`#893 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/893>`__)\n\n  .. attention::\n\n     v1.9.3 was the only version using the ``--pure-python`` setting name.\n     Later versions dropped the ``--`` prefix, making it just ``pure-python``.\n\n- Declared Python 3.12 supported officially in the distribution package metadata\n  -- by `@edgarrmondragon <https://github.com/sponsors/edgarrmondragon>`__. (`#942 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/942>`__)\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- A regression test for no-host URLs was added per `#821 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/821>`__\n  and ``3986`` -- by `@kenballus <https://github.com/sponsors/kenballus>`__. (`#821 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/821>`__, `#822 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/822>`__)\n- Started testing *yarl* against Python 3.12 in CI -- by `@mjpieters <https://github.com/sponsors/mjpieters>`__. (`#881 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/881>`__)\n- All Python 3.12 jobs are now marked as required to pass in CI\n  -- by `@edgarrmondragon <https://github.com/sponsors/edgarrmondragon>`__. (`#942 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/942>`__)\n- MyST is now integrated in Sphinx -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.\n\n  This allows the contributors to author new documents in Markdown\n  when they have difficulties with going straight RST. (`#953 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/953>`__)\n\n\n1.9.2 (2023-04-25)\n==================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Fix regression with ``__truediv__`` and absolute URLs with empty paths causing the raw path to lack the leading ``/``.\n  (`#854 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/854>`_)\n\n\n1.9.1 (2023-04-21)\n==================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Marked tests that fail on older Python patch releases (< 3.7.10, < 3.8.8 and < 3.9.2) as expected to fail due to missing a security fix for CVE-2021-23336. (`#850 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/850>`_)\n\n\n1.9.0 (2023-04-19)\n==================\n\nThis release was never published to PyPI, due to issues with the build process.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Added ``URL.joinpath(*elements)``, to create a new URL appending multiple path elements. (`#704 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/704>`_)\n- Made ``URL.__truediv__()`` return ``NotImplemented`` if called with an\n  unsupported type — by `@michaeljpeters <https://github.com/sponsors/michaeljpeters>`__.\n  (`#832 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/832>`_)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Path normalization for absolute URLs no longer raises a ValueError exception\n  when ``..`` segments would otherwise go beyond the URL path root.\n  (`#536 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/536>`_)\n- Fixed an issue with update_query() not getting rid of the query when argument is None. (`#792 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/792>`_)\n- Added some input restrictions on with_port() function to prevent invalid boolean inputs or out of valid port inputs; handled incorrect 0 port representation. (`#793 <https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/793>`_)\n- Made ``yarl.URL.build()`` raise a ``TypeError`` if the ``host`` argument is ``None`` — by `@paulpapacz <https://github.com/sponsors/paulpapacz>`__.

   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | N/A                |\n\n\n### OpenVINO\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[openvino,nncf]\n```\n\nIt is possible to export 🤗 Transformers and Diffusers models to the OpenVINO format easily:\n\n```bash\noptimum-cli export openvino --model distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english distilbert_sst2_ov\n```\n\nIf you add `--int8`, the weights will be quantized to INT8. Static quantization can also be applied on the activations using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf), more information can be found in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/intel/optimization_ov).\n\nTo load a model and run inference with OpenVINO Runtime, you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `OVModelForXxx` class. To load a PyTorch checkpoint and convert it to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, you can set `export=True` when loading your model.\n\n```diff\n- from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n+ from optimum.intel import OVModelForSequenceClassification\n  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline\n\n  model_id = \"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"\n  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n- model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)\n+ model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert_sst2_ov\")\n\n  classifier = pipeline(\"text-classification\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n  results = classifier(\"He's a dreadful magician.\")\n```\n\nYou can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/tree/main/examples/openvino).\n\n### Neural Compressor\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[neural-compressor]\n```\n\nDynamic quantization can be applied on your model:\n\n```bash\noptimum-cli inc quantize --model distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad --output ./quantized_distilbert\n```\n\nTo load a model quantized with Intel Neural Compressor, hosted locally or on the 🤗 hub, you can do as follows :\n```python\nfrom optimum.intel import INCModelForSequenceClassification\n\nmodel_id = \"Intel/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english-int8-dynamic\"\nmodel = INCModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)\n```\n\nYou can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/optimization_inc) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/tree/main/examples/neural_compressor).\n\n### ONNX + ONNX Runtime\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :\n\n```bash\npip install optimum[exporters,onnxruntime]\n```\n\nIt is possible to export 🤗 Transformers and Diffusers models to the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format and perform graph optimization as well as quantization easily:\n\n```plain\noptimum-cli export onnx -m deepset/roberta-base-squad2 --optimize O2 roberta_base_qa_onnx\n```\n\nThe model can then be quantized using `onnxruntime`:\n\n```bash\noptimum-cli onnxruntime quantize \\\n  --avx512 \\\n  --onnx_model roberta_base_qa_onnx \\\n  -o quantized_roberta_base_qa_onnx\n```\n\nThese commands will export `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` and perform [O2 graph optimization](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/onnxruntime/usage_guides/optimization#optimization-configuration) on the exported model, and finally quantize it with the [avx512 configuration](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/onnxruntime/package_reference/configuration#optimum.onnxruntime.AutoQuantizationConfig.avx512).\n\nFor more information on the ONNX export, please check the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/exporters/onnx/usage_guides/export_a_model).\n\n#### Run the exported model using ONNX Runtime\n\nOnce the model is exported to the ONNX format, we provide Python classes enabling you to run the exported ONNX model in a seemless manner using [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) in the backend:\n\n```diff\n- from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering\n+ from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForQuestionAnswering\n  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline\n\n  model_id = \"deepset/roberta-base-squad2\"\n  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n- model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_id)\n+ model = ORTModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(\"roberta_base_qa_onnx\")\n  qa_pipe = pipeline(\"question-answering\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n  question = \"What's Optimum?\"\n  context = \"Optimum is an awesome library everyone should use!\"\n  results = qa_pipe(question=question, context=context)\n```\n\nMore details on how to run ONNX models with `ORTModelForXXX` classes [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/onnxruntime/usage_guides/models).\n\n### TensorFlow Lite\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :\n\n```bash\npip install optimum[exporters-tf]\n```\n\nJust as for ONNX, it is possible to export models to [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) and quantize them:\n\n```plain\noptimum-cli export tflite \\\n  -m deepset/roberta-base-squad2 \\\n  --sequence_length 384  \\\n  --quantize int8-dynamic roberta_tflite_model\n```\n\n## Accelerated training\n\n🤗 Optimum provides wrappers around the original 🤗 Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) to enable training on powerful hardware easily.\nWe support many providers:\n\n- Habana's Gaudi processors\n- ONNX Runtime (optimized for GPUs)\n\n### Habana\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[habana]\n```\n\n```diff\n- from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments\n+ from optimum.habana import GaudiTrainer, GaudiTrainingArguments\n\n  # Download a pretrained model from the Hub\n  model = AutoModelForXxx.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n  # Define the training arguments\n- training_args = TrainingArguments(\n+ training_args = GaudiTrainingArguments(\n      output_dir=\"path/to/save/folder/\",\n+     use_habana=True,\n+     use_lazy_mode=True,\n+     gaudi_config_name=\"Habana/bert-base-uncased\",\n      ...\n  )\n\n  # Initialize the trainer\n- trainer = Trainer(\n+ trainer = GaudiTrainer(\n      model=model,\n      args=training_args,\n      train_dataset=train_dataset,\n      ...\n  )\n\n  # Use Habana Gaudi processor for training!\n  trainer.train()\n```\n\nYou can find more examples in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/habana/quickstart) and in the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana/tree/main/examples).\n\n### ONNX Runtime\n\n```diff\n- from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments\n+ from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTTrainer, ORTTrainingArguments\n\n  # Download a pretrained model from the Hub\n  model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\n  # Define the training arguments\n- training_args = TrainingArguments(\n+ training_args = ORTTrainingArguments(\n      output_dir=\"path/to/save/folder/\",\n      optim=\"adamw_ort_fused\",\n      ...\n  )\n\n  # Create a

internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.\n\nThe core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.\n\n## More Information\n\n- [Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)\n  - [Installation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\n  - [Handbook](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/index.html)\n- [Contribute](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n  - [Issues](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues)\n  - [Pull requests](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pulls)\n- [Release notes](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/index.html)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/CHANGES.rst)\n  - [Pre-fork](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#pre-fork)\n\n## Report a Vulnerability\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please follow the procedure described in the [Tidelift security policy](https://tidelift.com/docs/security).\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f8/3e/32cbd0129a28686621434cbf17bb64bf1458bfb838f1f668262fefce145c/pillow-10.2.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"The Python Imaging Library (PIL) is\n\n    Copyright © 1997-2011 by Secret Labs AB\n    Copyright © 1995-2011 by Fredrik Lundh\n\nPillow is the friendly PIL fork.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c.

Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"},{"attribution":"License agreement for matplotlib versions 1.3.0 and later\n=========================================================\n\n1.

Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\nWe are required to state that\n\"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n   1. Definitions\n      a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n      b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n      c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n      d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n      e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n      f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n      g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n      h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n      i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\n      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Definitions\n      a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n      b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n      c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n      d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n      e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n      f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n      g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n      h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n      i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n   2.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\n      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n   k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \"Licensor.\" The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n      a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   \n   NO WARRANTY 9.\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","GPL-2.0-only":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.

This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.

You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n< one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. >\nCopyright (C) < yyyy > < name of author >\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.

You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0.

Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.","GPL-3.0-or-later":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.","GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception":"﻿insert GPL v3 text here GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\nVersion 3.1, 31 March 2009\nGeneral information: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.","HPND":"Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer\n<copyright notice>\nPermission to use, copy, modify and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies , and that both that the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation , and that the name of <copyright holder> <or related entities> not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific, written prior permission . <copyright holder> makes no representations about the suitability of this software for any purpose.

Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\nIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\nWe are required to state that\n\"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.

It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Distribution Obligations.\n      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n         (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n         (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Application of this License.\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n   6. Versions of the License.\n      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n         [1] A Developer specific license.\n         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n   8. TERMINATION.\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors.

General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\n\n1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\n\n1.B. \"Project Gutenberg\" is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.\n\n1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (\"the Foundation\" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\n\n[*] This particular work is one of the few individual works protected by copyright law in the United States and most of the remainder of the world, included in the Project Gutenberg collection with the permission of the copyright holder. Information on the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the beginning of this work.\n\n1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.\n\n1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\n\n1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase \"Project Gutenberg\" appears, or with which the phrase \"Project Gutenberg\" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the United States, you’ll have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this ebook.\n\n1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase \"Project Gutenberg\" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\n\n1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder.

Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg-tm License.\n\n1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than \"Plain Vanilla ASCII\" or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original \"Plain Vanilla ASCII\" or other form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\n\n1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\n\n1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided that\n\n    You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, \"Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.\"\n    You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\n    You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work.\n    You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\n\n1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\n\n1.F.\n\n1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain \"Defects,\" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.\n\n1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\n1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.\n\n1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\n\n1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\n\n1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\n\nThe Foundation’s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n[*] This paragraph, after 1.C., is included only for copyrighted works.

REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS\n\nAll modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements:\n\n   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.\n   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.\n   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.\n   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.\n   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's (or authors') permission. \n\n\nV. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\n\n   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\n   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\n   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s). \n\n\nVI. LICENSE OPTIONS\n\nThe author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.\n\nA. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the explicit permission of the author(s). \"Substantive modification\" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\nB. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\n\nOPEN PUBLICATION POLICY APPENDIX:\n\n(This is not considered part of the license.)\n\nOpen Publication works are available in source format via the Open Publication home page at http://works.opencontent.org/.\n\nOpen Publication authors who want to include their own license on Open Publication works may do so, as long as their terms are not more restrictive than the Open Publication license.\n\nIf you have questions about the Open Publication License, please contact David Wiley, and/or the Open Publication Authors' List at opal@opencontent.org, via email.\n\nTo subscribe to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"subscribe\" in the body.\n\nTo post to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal@opencontent.org or simply reply to a previous post.\n\nTo unsubscribe from the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"unsubscribe\" in the body.","openssl-nokia-psk-contribution":"The portions of the attached software (\"Contribution\") is developed by\nNokia Corporation and is licensed pursuant to the OpenSSL open source\nlicense.\n\nThe Contribution, originally written by Mika Kousa and Pasi Eronen of\nNokia Corporation, consists of the \"PSK\" (Pre-Shared Key) ciphersuites\nsupport (see RFC 4279) to OpenSSL.\n\nNo patent licenses or other rights except those expressly stated in\nthe OpenSSL open source license shall be deemed granted or received\nexpressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.\n\nNo assurances are provided by Nokia that the Contribution does not\ninfringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any third\nparty or that the license provides you with all the necessary rights\nto make use of the Contribution.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
