You can\nread more at https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nThis package includes ASGI base libraries, such as:\n\n* Sync-to-async and async-to-sync function wrappers, ``asgiref.sync``\n* Server base classes, ``asgiref.server``\n* A WSGI-to-ASGI adapter, in ``asgiref.wsgi``\n\n\nFunction wrappers\n-----------------\n\nThese allow you to wrap or decorate async or sync functions to call them from\nthe other style (so you can call async functions from a synchronous thread,\nor vice-versa).\n\nIn particular:\n\n* AsyncToSync lets a synchronous subthread stop and wait while the async\n  function is called on the main thread's event loop, and then control is\n  returned to the thread when the async function is finished.\n\n* SyncToAsync lets async code call a synchronous function, which is run in\n  a threadpool and control returned to the async coroutine when the synchronous\n  function completes.\n\nThe idea is to make it easier to call synchronous APIs from async code and\nasynchronous APIs from synchronous code so it's easier to transition code from\none style to the other. In the case of Channels, we wrap the (synchronous)\nDjango view system with SyncToAsync to allow it to run inside the (asynchronous)\nASGI server.\n\nNote that exactly what threads things run in is very specific, and aimed to\nkeep maximum compatibility with old synchronous code. See\n\"Synchronous code & Threads\" below for a full explanation. By default,\n``sync_to_async`` will run all synchronous code in the program in the same\nthread for safety reasons; you can disable this for more performance with\n``@sync_to_async(thread_sensitive=False)``, but make sure that your code does\nnot rely on anything bound to threads (like database connections) when you do.\n\n\nThreadlocal replacement\n-----------------------\n\nThis is a drop-in replacement for ``threading.local`` that works with both\nthreads and asyncio Tasks. Even better, it will proxy values through from a\ntask-local context to a thread-local context when you use ``sync_to_async``\nto run things in a threadpool, and vice-versa for ``async_to_sync``.\n\nIf you instead want true thread- and task-safety, you can set\n``thread_critical`` on the Local object to ensure this instead.\n\n\nServer base classes\n-------------------\n\nIncludes a ``StatelessServer`` class which provides all the hard work of\nwriting a stateless server (as in, does not handle direct incoming sockets\nbut instead consumes external streams or sockets to work out what is happening).\n\nAn example of such a server would be a chatbot server that connects out to\na central chat server and provides a \"connection scope\" per user chatting to\nit. There's only one actual connection, but the server has to separate things\ninto several scopes for easier writing of the code.\n\nYou can see an example of this being used in `frequensgi <https://github.com/andrewgodwin/frequensgi>`_.\n\n\nWSGI-to-ASGI adapter\n--------------------\n\nAllows you to wrap a WSGI application so it appears as a valid ASGI application.\n\nSimply wrap it around your WSGI application like so::\n\n    asgi_application = WsgiToAsgi(wsgi_application)\n\nThe WSGI application will be run in a synchronous threadpool, and the wrapped\nASGI application will be one that accepts ``http`` class messages.\n\nPlease note that not all extended features of WSGI may be supported (such as\nfile handles for incoming POST bodies).\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n``asgiref`` requires Python 3.8 or higher.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease refer to the\n`main Channels contributing docs <https://github.com/django/channels/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.\n\n\nTesting\n'''''''\n\nTo run tests, make sure you have installed the ``tests`` extra with the package::\n\n    cd asgiref/\n    pip install -e .[tests]\n    pytest\n\n\nBuilding the documentation\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nThe documentation uses `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_::\n\n    cd asgiref/docs/\n    pip install sphinx\n\nTo build the docs, you can use the default tools::\n\n    sphinx-build -b html . _build/html  # or `make html`, if you've got make set up\n    cd _build/html\n    python -m http.server\n\n...or you can use ``sphinx-autobuild`` to run a server and rebuild/reload\nyour documentation changes automatically::\n\n    pip install sphinx-autobuild\n    sphinx-autobuild . _build/html\n\n\nReleasing\n'''''''''\n\nTo release, first add details to CHANGELOG.txt and update the version number in ``asgiref/__init__.py``.\n\nThen, build and push the packages::\n\n    python -m build\n    twine upload dist/*\n    rm -r build/ dist/\n\n\nImplementation Details\n----------------------\n\nSynchronous code & threads\n''''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nThe ``asgiref.sync`` module provides two wrappers that let you go between\nasynchronous and synchronous code at will, while taking care of the rough edges\nfor you.\n\nUnfortunately, the rough edges are numerous, and the code has to work especially\nhard to keep things in the same thread as much as possible. Notably, the\nrestrictions we are working with are:\n\n* All synchronous code called through ``SyncToAsync`` and marked with\n  ``thread_sensitive`` should run in the same thread as each other (and if the\n  outer layer of the program is synchronous, the main thread)\n\n* If a thread already has a running async loop, ``AsyncToSync`` can't run things\n  on that loop if it's blocked on synchronous code that is above you in the\n  call stack.\n\nThe first compromise you get to might be that ``thread_sensitive`` code should\njust run in the same thread and not spawn in a sub-thread, fulfilling the first\nrestriction, but that immediately runs you into the second restriction.\n\nThe only real solution is to essentially have a variant of ThreadPoolExecutor\nthat executes any ``thread_sensitive`` code on the outermost synchronous\nthread - either the main thread, or a single spawned subthread.\n\nThis means you now have two basic states:\n\n* If the outermost layer of your program is synchronous, then all async code\n  run through ``AsyncToSync`` will run in a per-call event loop in arbitrary\n  sub-threads, while all ``thread_sensitive`` code will run in the main thread.\n\n* If the outermost layer of your program is asynchronous, then all async code\n  runs on the main thread's event loop, and all ``thread_sensitive`` synchronous\n  code will run in a single shared sub-thread.\n\nCrucially, this means that in both cases there is a thread which is a shared\nresource that all ``thread_sensitive`` code must run on, and there is a chance\nthat this thread is currently blocked on its own ``AsyncToSync`` call. Thus,\n``AsyncToSync`` needs to act as an executor for thread code while it's blocking.\n\nThe ``CurrentThreadExecutor`` class provides this functionality; rather than\nsimply waiting on a Future, you can call its ``run_until_future`` method and\nit will run submitted code until that Future is done. This means that code\ninside the call can then run code on your thread.\n\n\nMaintenance and Security\n------------------------\n\nTo report security issues, please contact security@djangoproject.com.

Also it's much faster than ``asyncio.wait_for()``\nbecause ``timeout`` doesn't create a new task.\n\nThe ``timeout(delay, *, loop=None)`` call returns a context manager\nthat cancels a block on *timeout* expiring::\n\n   from async_timeout import timeout\n   async with timeout(1.5):\n       await inner()\n\n1. If ``inner()`` is executed faster than in ``1.5`` seconds nothing\n   happens.\n2. Otherwise ``inner()`` is cancelled internally by sending\n   ``asyncio.CancelledError`` into but ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` is\n   raised outside of context manager scope.\n\n*timeout* parameter could be ``None`` for skipping timeout functionality.\n\n\nAlternatively, ``timeout_at(when)`` can be used for scheduling\nat the absolute time::\n\n   loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n   now = loop.time()\n\n   async with timeout_at(now + 1.5):\n       await inner()\n\n\nPlease note: it is not POSIX time but a time with\nundefined starting base, e.g. the time of the system power on.\n\n\nContext manager has ``.expired`` property for check if timeout happens\nexactly in context manager::\n\n   async with timeout(1.5) as cm:\n       await inner()\n   print(cm.expired)\n\nThe property is ``True`` if ``inner()`` execution is cancelled by\ntimeout context manager.\n\nIf ``inner()`` call explicitly raises ``TimeoutError`` ``cm.expired``\nis ``False``.\n\nThe scheduled deadline time is available as ``.deadline`` property::\n\n   async with timeout(1.5) as cm:\n       cm.deadline\n\nNot finished yet timeout can be rescheduled by ``shift_by()``\nor ``shift_to()`` methods::\n\n   async with timeout(1.5) as cm:\n       cm.shift(1)  # add another second on waiting\n       cm.update(loop.time() + 5)  # reschedule to now+5 seconds\n\nRescheduling is forbidden if the timeout is expired or after exit from ``async with``\ncode block.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n   $ pip install async-timeout\n\nThe library is Python 3 only!\n\n\n\nAuthors and License\n-------------------\n\nThe module is written by Andrew Svetlov.\n\nIt's *Apache 2* licensed and freely available.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/87/d6/21b30a550dafea84b1b8eee21b5e23fa16d010ae006011221f33dcd8d7f8/async-timeout-4.0.3.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2016-2020 aio-libs collaboration.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n","name":"Apache-2.0"}],"notes":[],"otherLicenses":[],"package":"async-timeout","projectUrl":"https://github.com/aio-libs/async-timeout","source":"pip","title":"async-timeout","version":"4.0.3"},{"authors":["me@kennethreitz.com"],"dependencyPaths":["geventhttpclient > certifi"],"description":"Certifi: Python SSL Certificates\n================================\n\nCertifi provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for\nvalidating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity\nof TLS hosts.

This file is included into docs/history.rst\n\n\nGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent\nprogramming.\n\nThe \"greenlet\" package is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version of\nCPython that supports micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run\npseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)\nand are synchronized with data exchanges on \"channels\".\n\nA \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of\nmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.\nThis is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.\nYou can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;\nhowever, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to\nmake advanced control flow structures.

This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network\nAPI, and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded,\nasynchronous, or your own implementation of `RFC 6214\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6214>`_ -- h11 won't judge you.\n(Compare this to the current state of the art, where every time a `new\nnetwork API <https://trio.readthedocs.io/>`_ comes along then someone\ngets to start over reimplementing the entire HTTP protocol from\nscratch.) Cory Benfield made an `excellent blog post describing the\nbenefits of this approach\n<https://lukasa.co.uk/2015/10/The_New_Hyper/>`_, or if you like video\nthen here's his `PyCon 2016 talk on the same theme\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cC3_jGwl_U>`_.\n\nThis also means that h11 is not immediately useful out of the box:\nit's a toolkit for building programs that speak HTTP, not something\nthat could directly replace ``requests`` or ``twisted.web`` or\nwhatever. But h11 makes it much easier to implement something like\n``requests`` or ``twisted.web``.\n\nAt a high level, working with h11 goes like this:\n\n1) First, create an ``h11.Connection`` object to track the state of a\n   single HTTP/1.1 connection.\n\n2) When you read data off the network, pass it to\n   ``conn.receive_data(...)``; you'll get back a list of objects\n   representing high-level HTTP \"events\".\n\n3) When you want to send a high-level HTTP event, create the\n   corresponding \"event\" object and pass it to ``conn.send(...)``;\n   this will give you back some bytes that you can then push out\n   through the network.\n\nFor example, a client might instantiate and then send a\n``h11.Request`` object, then zero or more ``h11.Data`` objects for the\nrequest body (e.g., if this is a POST), and then a\n``h11.EndOfMessage`` to indicate the end of the message. Then the\nserver would then send back a ``h11.Response``, some ``h11.Data``, and\nits own ``h11.EndOfMessage``. If either side violates the protocol,\nyou'll get a ``h11.ProtocolError`` exception.\n\nh11 is suitable for implementing both servers and clients, and has a\npleasantly symmetric API: the events you send as a client are exactly\nthe ones that you receive as a server and vice-versa.\n\n`Here's an example of a tiny HTTP client\n<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/examples/basic-client.py>`_\n\nIt also has `a fine manual <https://h11.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n*Whyyyyy?*\n\nI wanted to play with HTTP in `Curio\n<https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`__ and `Trio\n<https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__, which at the time didn't have any\nHTTP libraries. So I thought, no big deal, Python has, like, a dozen\ndifferent implementations of HTTP, surely I can find one that's\nreusable. I didn't find one, but I did find Cory's call-to-arms\nblog-post. So I figured, well, fine, if I have to implement HTTP from\nscratch, at least I can make sure no-one *else* has to ever again.\n\n*Should I use it?*\n\nMaybe. You should be aware that it's a very young project. But, it's\nfeature complete and has an exhaustive test-suite and complete docs,\nso the next step is for people to try using it and see how it goes\n:-). If you do then please let us know -- if nothing else we'll want\nto talk to you before making any incompatible changes!\n\n*What are the features/limitations?*\n\nRoughly speaking, it's trying to be a robust, complete, and non-hacky\nimplementation of the first \"chapter\" of the HTTP/1.1 spec: `RFC 7230:\nHTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230>`_. That is, it mostly focuses on\nimplementing HTTP at the level of taking bytes on and off the wire,\nand the headers related to that, and tries to be anal about spec\nconformance. It doesn't know about higher-level concerns like URL\nrouting, conditional GETs, cross-origin cookie policies, or content\nnegotiation. But it does know how to take care of framing,\ncross-version differences in keep-alive handling, and the \"obsolete\nline folding\" rule, so you can focus your energies on the hard /\ninteresting parts for your application, and it tries to support the\nfull specification in the sense that any useful HTTP/1.1 conformant\napplication should be able to use h11.\n\nIt's pure Python, and has no dependencies outside of the standard\nlibrary.\n\nIt has a test suite with 100.0% coverage for both statements and\nbranches.\n\nCurrently it supports Python 3 (testing on 3.7-3.10) and PyPy 3.\nThe last Python 2-compatible version was h11 0.11.x.\n(Originally it had a Cython wrapper for `http-parser\n<https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser>`_ and a beautiful nested state\nmachine implemented with ``yield from`` to postprocess the output. But\nI had to take these out -- the new *parser* needs fewer lines-of-code\nthan the old *parser wrapper*, is written in pure Python, uses no\nexotic language syntax, and has more features. It's sad, really; that\nold state machine was really slick. I just need a few sentences here\nto mourn that.)\n\nI don't know how fast it is. I haven't benchmarked or profiled it yet,\nso it's probably got a few pointless hot spots, and I've been trying\nto err on the side of simplicity and robustness instead of\nmicro-optimization. But at the architectural level I tried hard to\navoid fundamentally bad decisions, e.g., I believe that all the\nparsing algorithms remain linear-time even in the face of pathological\ninput like slowloris, and there are no byte-by-byte loops. (I also\nbelieve that it maintains bounded memory usage in the face of\narbitrary/pathological input.)\n\nThe whole library is ~800 lines-of-code. You can read and understand\nthe whole thing in less than an hour. Most of the energy invested in\nthis so far has been spent on trying to keep things simple by\nminimizing special-cases and ad hoc state manipulation; even though it\nis now quite small and simple, I'm still annoyed that I haven't\nfigured out how to make it even smaller and simpler. (Unfortunately,\nHTTP does not lend itself to simplicity.)\n\nThe API is ~feature complete and I don't expect the general outlines\nto change much, but you can't judge an API's ergonomics until you\nactually document and use it, so I'd expect some changes in the\ndetails.\n\n*How do I try it?*\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n  $ pip install h11\n  $ git clone git@github.com:python-hyper/h11\n  $ cd h11/examples\n  $ python basic-client.py\n\nand go from there.\n\n*License?*\n\nMIT\n\n*Code of conduct?*\n\nContributors are requested to follow our `code of conduct\n<https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ in\nall project spaces.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f5/38/3af3d3633a34a3316095b39c8e8fb4853a28a536e55d347bd8d8e9a14b03/h11-0.14.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Nathaniel J.

This is the latest version of\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna2008'))\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna2008'))\n    домен.испытание\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping that was developed by the\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementers should use transitional processing with caution, only in\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\nresults.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\nmodule name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\n\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\n  While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable\n  issues being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your\n  requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bf/3f/ea4b9117521a1e9c50344b909be7886dd00a519552724809bb1f486986c2/idna-3.6.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"BSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2023, Kim Davies and contributors.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n1.

The ``opentelemetry-distro``\n    package contains the default distro and configurator and automatically configures some of the common options for users.\n    For more info about ``opentelemetry-distro`` check `here <https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/distro/README.html>`__\n    ::\n\n        pip install \"opentelemetry-distro[otlp]\"\n\n    When creating a custom distro and/or configurator, be sure to add entry points for each under `opentelemetry_distro` and `opentelemetry_configurator` respectfully.\n    If you have entry points for multiple distros or configurators present in your environment, you should specify the entry point name of the distro and configurator you want to be used via the `OTEL_PYTHON_DISTRO` and `OTEL_PYTHON_CONFIGURATOR` environment variables.\n\n\nopentelemetry-bootstrap\n-----------------------\n\n::\n\n    opentelemetry-bootstrap [-a |--action=][install|requirements]\n\nThis command install default instrumentation packages and detects active Python site-packages\nto figure out which instrumentation packages the user might want to install. By default, it\nprints out a list of the default and detected instrumentation packages that can be added to a\nrequirements.txt file. It also supports installing the packages when run with\n:code:`--action=install` or :code:`-a install` flag. All default and detectable\ninstrumentation packages are defined `here <https://github.com/flands/opentelemetry-python-contrib/blob/main/opentelemetry-instrumentation/src/opentelemetry/instrumentation/bootstrap_gen.py>`.\n\n\nopentelemetry-instrument\n------------------------\n\n::\n\n    opentelemetry-instrument python program.py\n\nThe instrument command will try to automatically detect packages used by your python program\nand when possible, apply automatic tracing instrumentation on them. This means your program\nwill get automatic distributed tracing without having to make any code changes. This will\nalso configure a global tracer and tracing exporter as well as a meter and meter exporter.\nBy default, the instrument command will use the OTLP exporter but this can be overridden.\n\nThe command supports the following configuration options as CLI arguments and environment\nvariables:\n\n\n* ``--traces_exporter`` or ``OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER``\n* ``--metrics_exporter`` or ``OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER``\n* ``--distro`` or ``OTEL_PYTHON_DISTRO``\n* ``--configurator`` or ``OTEL_PYTHON_CONFIGURATOR``\n\nThe exporter options define what exporter destination to use and can be set to one or more\nexporter names (see below). You can pass multiple values to configure multiple exporters\n(e.g., ``zipkin_json,otlp``).\n\n    - Defaults to `otlp`.\n    - Can be set to `none` to disable automatic tracer initialization.\n    - Can be set to 'console` to display JSON results locally.\n\nTrace exporter names:\n\n    - jaeger_proto\n    - jaeger_thrift\n    - opencensus\n    - otlp\n    - otlp_proto_grpc (`deprecated`)\n    - otlp_proto_http (`deprecated`)\n    - zipkin_json\n    - zipkin_proto\n\nMetric exporter names:\n\n    - otlp\n    - otlp_proto_grpc (`deprecated`)\n    - prometheus\n\nNote: The default transport protocol for ``otlp`` is gRPC.\n\n* ``--id-generator`` or ``OTEL_PYTHON_ID_GENERATOR``\n\nUsed to specify which IDs Generator to use for the global Tracer Provider. By default, it\nwill use the random IDs generator.\n\nThe code in ``program.py`` needs to use one of the packages for which there is\nan OpenTelemetry integration. For a list of the available integrations please\ncheck `here <https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#integrations>`_\n\n* ``OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS``\n\nIf set by the user, opentelemetry-instrument will read this environment variable to disable specific instrumentations.\ne.g OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS = \"requests,django\"\n\n\nExamples\n^^^^^^^^\n\n::\n\n    opentelemetry-instrument --traces_exporter console flask run --port=3000\n\nThe above command will pass ``--traces_exporter console`` to the instrument command and ``--port=3000`` to ``flask run``.\n\n::\n\n    opentelemetry-instrument --traces_exporter zipkin_json,otlp celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info\n\nThe above command will configure global trace provider, attach zipkin and otlp exporters to it and then\nstart celery with the rest of the arguments.\n\n::\n\n    opentelemetry-instrument --id_generator random flask run --port=3000\n\nThe above command will configure the global trace provider to use the Random IDs Generator, and then\npass ``--port=3000`` to ``flask run``.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* `OpenTelemetry Project <https://opentelemetry.io/>`_\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bf/e3/b2a8260862d278ac2505c8cb61d11185349f5ea537946220f5c7d738de2a/opentelemetry_instrumentation-0.44b0-py3-none-any.whl","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\n* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\n* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\n  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\n  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\n  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\n  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\n  and Windows registry-based time zones.\n* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\n  Olson's database.\n* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\n  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\n* A comprehensive test suite.\n\nQuick example\n=============\nHere's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\npackage. For more examples, look at the documentation.\n\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\ndate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n    >>> from datetime import *\n    >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n    >>> today = now.date()\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n    >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\n    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n    >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n    >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).

Alternatively you can do a plain\n          ``clone`` immediately followed by a ``git submodule update --init``.\n\n          Alternatively, if you already have (a *compatible* version of)\n          RapidJSON includes around, you can compile the module specifying\n          their location with the option ``--rj-include-dir``, for example:\n\n          .. code-block:: shell\n\n             $ python3 setup.py build --rj-include-dir=/usr/include/rapidjson\n\nA set of makefiles implement most common operations, such as *build*, *check*\nand *release*; see ``make help`` output for a list of available targets.\n\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\n``python-rapidjson`` tries to be as performant as possible while staying\ncompatible with the ``json`` module.\n\nSee the `this section`__ in the documentation for a comparison with other JSON libraries.\n\n__ https://python-rapidjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.html\n\n\nIncompatibility\n---------------\n\nAlthough we tried to implement an API similar to the standard library ``json``, being a\nstrict *drop-in* replacement in not our goal and we have decided to depart from there in\nsome aspects. See `this section`__ in the documentation for further details.\n\n__ https://python-rapidjson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#incompatibilities\n\n.. _RapidJSON:

This library allows\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\n\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\n\n.. note::\n\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\nstandard Python distutils.\n\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\n\n    pip install pytz\n\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\nadministrative user::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\npytz for Enterprise\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.\n\n\nExample & Usage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLocalized times and date arithmetic\n-----------------------------------\n\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n>>> from pytz import timezone\n>>> import pytz\n>>> utc = pytz.utc\n>>> utc.zone\n'UTC'\n>>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')\n>>> eastern.zone\n'US/Eastern'\n>>> amsterdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')\n>>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z'\n\nThis library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\ninformation):\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\n\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\n\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\n\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Does not work this way!\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\n\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\nas UTC:\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Not recommended except for UTC\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\n\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\nby humans.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\n\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\ntimezone.\n\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\n\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\nsection for more details)\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\nstandard astimezone method.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\nTrue\n\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\ndeal with.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n\n\n``tzinfo`` API\n--------------\n\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\n\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\n\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\n\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used\nduring DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds\n3600\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 20:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\ndatetime.timedelta(0)\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\n'NST'\n\nIf ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise\nan ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError`` exception.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> import pytz.exceptions\n>>> try:\n...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.dst(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n\n\nProblems with Localtime\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes\nmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\nhappens:\n\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\n\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\n\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\n\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\n\n>>> import pickle, pytz\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\n17\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\n>>> new == dt\nTrue\n>>> new is dt\nFalse\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\nTrue\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\nTrue\n\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\nnot compare the same in Python.\n\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\nFalse\n\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\n\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\n\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\n\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\ntimes.\n\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\nTime:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\n\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\nthe entire hour:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\n\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\neasier:\n\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n\n\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\n\n\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\n'0:24:01'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\n'0:00:01'\n\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\n\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\nincluded for tests only!):\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\n>>> str(dt)\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\n\nNotice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are\ncorrect, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are\nactually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00'\n>>> str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00'\n\n\nCountry Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use\nfor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.\nIt returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant\ntzinfo instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:\n\n>>> print(' '.join(pytz.country_timezones['nz']))\nPacific/Auckland Pacific/Chatham\n\nThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country\nname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:\n\n>>> print(pytz.country_names['nz'])\nNew Zealand\n\n\nWhat is UTC\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n'UTC' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It is a successor to, but distinct\nfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal\nTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time\nmeasurement.\n\nAll other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like\nUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No\ndaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform\ndate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused\nby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or\nmobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.\n\n..  _Coordinated Universal Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\n\n\nHelpers\n~~~~~~~\n\nThere are two lists of timezones provided.\n\n``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can\nbe used.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones\n>>> len(all_timezones) >= 500\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in all_timezones\nTrue\n\n``common_timezones`` is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn't\ncontain deprecated zones or historical zones, except for a few I've\ndeemed in common usage, such as US/Eastern (open a bug report if you\nthink other timezones are deserving of being included here). It is also\na sequence of strings.\n\n>>> from pytz import common_timezones\n>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in common_timezones\nFalse\n>>> 'Australia/Melbourne' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Canada/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in all_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in common_timezones\nFalse\n\nBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are alphabetically\nsorted:\n\n>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]\n>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> common_timezones == common_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]\n>>> all_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n\n``all_timezones`` and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set, common_timezones_set\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in all_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Victoria' in common_timezones_set\nFalse\n\nYou can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countries\nusing the ``country_timezones()`` function.

Python packages such as\n`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_\nand Thomas Khyn's `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be used\nto access these translations from Python.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nMIT license.\n\nThis code is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope Public\nLicense,  Version 2.1 (ZPL).\n\nI'm happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in other\nopen source projects.\n\n\nLatest Versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package will be updated after releases of the Olson timezone\ndatabase.  The latest version can be downloaded from the `Python Package\nIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The code that is used\nto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and available\nusing git::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.git\n\nAnnouncements of new releases are made on\n`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the\n`Atom feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_\nhosted there.\n\n\nBugs, Feature Requests & Patches\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBugs should be reported on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.\nFeature requests are unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directed\nto timezone support now built into Python or packages that work with it.\n\n\nSecurity Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReports about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.\n\n\nIssues & Limitations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects using Python 3.9 or later\n  are best served by using the timezone functionaly now included in core\n  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n\n- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the nearest whole minute, so timezones\n  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will be up to 30 seconds out. This\n  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.\n\n- If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can't fix\n  it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and\n  changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.\n  If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing\n  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMore info than you want to know about timezones:\nhttps://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html\n\n\nContact\n~~~~~~~\n\nStuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ae/fd/c5bafe60236bc2a464452f916b6a1806257109c8954d6a7d19e5d4fb012f/pytz-2023.4.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2003-2019 Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"),\nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,\nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You can use any of its components independently.\n\n```python\nfrom starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse\n\n\nasync def app(scope, receive, send):\n    assert scope['type'] == 'http'\n    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')\n    await response(scope, receive, send)\n```\n\nRun the `app` application in `example.py`:\n\n```shell\n$ uvicorn example:app\nINFO: Started server process [11509]\nINFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\nRun uvicorn with `--reload` to enable auto-reloading on code changes.\n\n## Modularity\n\nThe modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes building re-usable\ncomponents that can be shared between any ASGI framework.

Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"}],"package":"urllib3","projectUrl":"https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/2.2.1/","source":"pip","title":"urllib3","version":"2.2.1"},{"authors":["Graham.Dumpleton@gmail.com"],"dependencyPaths":["opentelemetry-instrumentation-grpc > wrapt","opentelemetry-instrumentation-grpc > opentelemetry-instrumentation > wrapt","opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi > opentelemetry-instrumentation > wrapt","opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi > opentelemetry-instrumentation-asgi > opentelemetry-instrumentation > wrapt"],"description":"wrapt\n=====\n\n|Actions| |PyPI|\n\nThe aim of the **wrapt** module is to provide a transparent object proxy\nfor Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function\nwrappers and decorator functions.\n\nThe **wrapt** module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes\nway beyond existing mechanisms such as ``functools.wraps()`` to ensure that\ndecorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities\netc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in\nfar more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and\nconsistent behaviour.\n\nTo ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module\nis used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a\npure Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not\nhave a compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFor further information on the **wrapt** module see:\n\n* http://wrapt.readthedocs.org/\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nTo implement your decorator you need to first define a wrapper function.\nThis will be called each time a decorated function is called. The wrapper\nfunction needs to take four positional arguments:\n\n* ``wrapped`` - The wrapped function which in turns needs to be called by your wrapper function.\n* ``instance`` - The object to which the wrapped function was bound when it was called.\n* ``args`` - The list of positional arguments supplied when the decorated function was called.\n* ``kwargs`` - The dictionary of keyword arguments supplied when the decorated function was called.\n\nThe wrapper function would do whatever it needs to, but would usually in\nturn call the wrapped function that is passed in via the ``wrapped``\nargument.\n\nThe decorator ``@wrapt.decorator`` then needs to be applied to the wrapper\nfunction to convert it into a decorator which can in turn be applied to\nother functions.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import wrapt\n    \n    @wrapt.decorator\n    def pass_through(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\n        return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    @pass_through\n    def function():\n        pass\n\nIf you wish to implement a decorator which accepts arguments, then wrap the\ndefinition of the decorator in a function closure. Any arguments supplied\nto the outer function when the decorator is applied, will be available to\nthe inner wrapper when the wrapped function is called.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import wrapt\n\n    def with_arguments(myarg1, myarg2):\n        @wrapt.decorator\n        def wrapper(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\n            return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n\n    @with_arguments(1, 2)\n    def function():\n        pass\n\nWhen applied to a normal function or static method, the wrapper function\nwhen called will be passed ``None`` as the ``instance`` argument.\n\nWhen applied to an instance method, the wrapper function when called will\nbe passed the instance of the class the method is being called on as the\n``instance`` argument. This will be the case even when the instance method\nwas called explicitly via the class and the instance passed as the first\nargument. That is, the instance will never be passed as part of ``args``.\n\nWhen applied to a class method, the wrapper function when called will be\npassed the class type as the ``instance`` argument.\n\nWhen applied to a class, the wrapper function when called will be passed\n``None`` as the ``instance`` argument. The ``wrapped`` argument in this\ncase will be the class.\n\nThe above rules can be summarised with the following example.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import inspect\n    \n    @wrapt.decorator\n    def universal(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):\n        if instance is None:\n            if inspect.isclass(wrapped):\n                # Decorator was applied to a class.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n            else:\n                # Decorator was applied to a function or staticmethod.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n        else:\n            if inspect.isclass(instance):\n                # Decorator was applied to a classmethod.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n            else:\n                # Decorator was applied to an instancemethod.\n                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)\n\nUsing these checks it is therefore possible to create a universal decorator\nthat can be applied in all situations. It is no longer necessary to create\ndifferent variants of decorators for normal functions and instance methods,\nor use additional wrappers to convert a function decorator into one that\nwill work for instance methods.\n\nIn all cases, the wrapped function passed to the wrapper function is called\nin the same way, with ``args`` and ``kwargs`` being passed. The\n``instance`` argument doesn't need to be used in calling the wrapped\nfunction.\n\nRepository\n----------\n\nFull source code for the **wrapt** module, including documentation files\nand unit tests, can be obtained from github.\n\n* https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt\n\n.. |Actions| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/Test/develop?logo=github&cacheSeconds=600\n   :target: https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/actions\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wrapt.svg?logo=python&cacheSeconds=3600\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wrapt\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/11/eb/e06e77394d6cf09977d92bff310cb0392930c08a338f99af6066a5a98f92/wrapt-1.14.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2013-2022, Graham Dumpleton\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

So, this package can be considered as implementation of\nthe `Design By Contract`_ methodology support in Python.\n\n.. _Design By Contract: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract\n\nFor detailed documentation, please see https://zopeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n=========\n Changes\n=========\n\n6.2 (2024-02-16)\n================\n\n- Add preliminary support for Python 3.13 as of 3.13a3.\n\n- Add support to use the pipe (``|``) syntax for ``typing.Union``.\n  (`#280 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/280>`_)\n\n\n6.1 (2023-10-05)\n================\n\n- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.12.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.12.\n\n- Fix building of the docs for non-final versions.\n\n\n6.0 (2023-03-17)\n================\n\n- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.11.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n- Fix test deprecation warning on Python 3.11.\n\n- Add preliminary support for Python 3.12 as of 3.12a5.\n\n- Drop:\n\n    + `zope.interface.implements`\n    + `zope.interface.implementsOnly`\n    + `zope.interface.classProvides`\n\n\n5.5.2 (2022-11-17)\n==================\n\n- Add support for building arm64 wheels on macOS.\n\n\n5.5.1 (2022-11-03)\n==================\n\n- Add support for final Python 3.11 release.\n\n\n5.5.0 (2022-10-10)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 (as of 3.11.0rc2).\n\n- Add missing Trove classifier showing support for Python 3.9.\n\n- Add some more entries to ``zope.interface.interfaces.__all__``.\n\n- Disable unsafe math optimizations in C code.  See `pull request 262\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/262>`_.\n\n\n5.4.0 (2021-04-15)\n==================\n\n- Make the C implementation of the ``__providedBy__`` descriptor stop\n  ignoring all errors raised when accessing the instance's\n  ``__provides__``. Now it behaves like the Python version and only\n  catches ``AttributeError``. The previous behaviour could lead to\n  crashing the interpreter in cases of recursion and errors. See\n  `issue 239 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues>`_.\n\n- Update the ``repr()`` and ``str()`` of various objects to be shorter\n  and more informative. In many cases, the ``repr()`` is now something\n  that can be evaluated to produce an equal object. For example, what\n  was previously printed as ``<implementedBy builtins.list>`` is now\n  shown as ``classImplements(list, IMutableSequence, IIterable)``. See\n  `issue 236 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/236>`_.\n\n- Make ``Declaration.__add__`` (as in ``implementedBy(Cls) +\n  ISomething``) try harder to preserve a consistent resolution order\n  when the two arguments share overlapping pieces of the interface\n  inheritance hierarchy. Previously, the right hand side was always\n  put at the end of the resolution order, which could easily produce\n  invalid orders. See `issue 193\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/193>`_.\n\n5.3.0 (2020-03-21)\n==================\n\n- No changes from 5.3.0a1\n\n\n5.3.0a1 (2021-03-18)\n====================\n\n- Improve the repr of ``zope.interface.Provides`` to remove ambiguity\n  about what is being provided. This is especially helpful diagnosing\n  IRO issues.\n\n- Allow subclasses of ``BaseAdapterRegistry`` (including\n  ``AdapterRegistry`` and ``VerifyingAdapterRegistry``) to have\n  control over the data structures. This allows persistent\n  implementations such as those based on ZODB to choose more scalable\n  options (e.g., BTrees instead of dicts). See `issue 224\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/224>`_.\n\n- Fix a reference counting issue in ``BaseAdapterRegistry`` that could\n  lead to references to interfaces being kept around even when all\n  utilities/adapters/subscribers providing that interface have been\n  removed. This is mostly an issue for persistent implementations.\n  Note that this only corrects the issue moving forward, it does not\n  solve any already corrupted reference counts. See `issue 227\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/227>`_.\n\n- Add the method ``BaseAdapterRegistry.rebuild()``. This can be used\n  to fix the reference counting issue mentioned above, as well as to\n  update the data structures when custom data types have changed.\n\n- Add the interface method ``IAdapterRegistry.subscribed()`` and\n  implementation ``BaseAdapterRegistry.subscribed()`` for querying\n  directly registered subscribers. See `issue 230\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/230>`_.\n\n- Add the maintenance method\n  ``Components.rebuildUtilityRegistryFromLocalCache()``. Most users\n  will not need this, but it can be useful if the ``Components.utilities``\n  registry is suspected to be out of sync with the ``Components``\n  object itself (this might happen to persistent ``Components``\n  implementations in the face of bugs).\n\n- Fix the ``Provides`` and ``ClassProvides`` descriptors to stop\n  allowing redundant interfaces (those already implemented by the\n  underlying class or meta class) to produce an inconsistent\n  resolution order. This is similar to the change in ``@implementer``\n  in 5.1.0, and resolves inconsistent resolution orders with\n  ``zope.proxy`` and ``zope.location``. See `issue 207\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/207>`_.\n\n5.2.0 (2020-11-05)\n==================\n\n- Add documentation section ``Persistency and Equality``\n  (`#218 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/218>`_).\n\n- Create arm64 wheels.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.9.\n\n\n5.1.2 (2020-10-01)\n==================\n\n- Make sure to call each invariant only once when validating invariants.\n  Previously, invariants could be called multiple times because when an\n  invariant is defined in an interface, it's found by in all interfaces\n  inheriting from that interface.  See `pull request 215\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/215/>`_.\n\n5.1.1 (2020-09-30)\n==================\n\n- Fix the method definitions of ``IAdapterRegistry.subscribe``,\n  ``subscriptions`` and ``subscribers``. Previously, they all were\n  defined to accept a ``name`` keyword argument, but subscribers have\n  no names and the implementation of that interface did not accept\n  that argument. See `issue 208\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/208>`_.\n\n- Fix a potential reference leak in the C optimizations. Previously,\n  applications that dynamically created unique ``Specification``\n  objects (e.g., used ``@implementer`` on dynamic classes) could\n  notice a growth of small objects over time leading to increased\n  garbage collection times. See `issue 216\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/216>`_.\n\n  .. caution::\n\n     This leak could prevent interfaces used as the bases of\n     other interfaces from being garbage collected. Those interfaces\n     will now be collected.\n\n     One way in which this would manifest was that ``weakref.ref``\n     objects (and things built upon them, like\n     ``Weak[Key|Value]Dictionary``) would continue to have access to\n     the original object even if there were no other visible\n     references to Python and the original object *should* have been\n     collected. This could be especially problematic for the\n     ``WeakKeyDictionary`` when combined with dynamic or local\n     (created in the scope of a function) interfaces, since interfaces\n     are hashed based just on their name and module name. See the\n     linked issue for an example of a resulting ``KeyError``.\n\n     Note that such potential errors are not new, they are just once\n     again a possibility.\n\n5.1.0 (2020-04-08)\n==================\n\n- Make ``@implementer(*iface)`` and ``classImplements(cls, *iface)``\n  ignore redundant interfaces. If the class already implements an\n  interface through inheritance, it is no longer redeclared\n  specifically for *cls*. This solves many instances of inconsistent\n  resolution orders, while still allowing the interface to be declared\n  for readability and maintenance purposes. See `issue 199\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/199>`_.\n\n- Remove all bare ``except:`` statements. Previously, when accessing\n  special attributes such as ``__provides__``, ``__providedBy__``,\n  ``__class__`` and ``__conform__``, this package wrapped such access\n  in a bare ``except:`` statement, meaning that many errors could pass\n  silently; typically this would result in a fallback path being taken\n  and sometimes (like with ``providedBy()``) the result would be\n  non-sensical. This is especially true when those attributes are\n  implemented with descriptors. Now, only ``AttributeError`` is\n  caught. This makes errors more obvious.\n\n  Obviously, this means that some exceptions will be propagated\n  differently than before. In particular, ``RuntimeError`` raised by\n  Acquisition in the case of circular containment will now be\n  propagated. Previously, when adapting such a broken object, a\n  ``TypeError`` would be the common result, but now it will be a more\n  informative ``RuntimeError``.\n\n  In addition, ZODB errors like ``POSKeyError`` could now be\n  propagated where previously they would ignored by this package.\n\n  See `issue 200 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/200>`_.\n\n- Require that the second argument (*bases*) to ``InterfaceClass`` is\n  a tuple. This only matters when directly using ``InterfaceClass`` to\n  create new interfaces dynamically. Previously, an individual\n  interface was allowed, but did not work correctly. Now it is\n  consistent with ``type`` and requires a tuple.\n\n- Let interfaces define custom ``__adapt__`` methods. This implements\n  the other side of the :pep:`246` adaptation protocol: objects being\n  adapted could already implement ``__conform__`` if they know about\n  the interface, and now interfaces can implement ``__adapt__`` if\n  they know about particular objects. There is no performance penalty\n  for interfaces that do not supply custom ``__adapt__`` methods.\n\n  This includes the ability to add new methods, or override existing\n  interface methods using the new ``@interfacemethod`` decorator.\n\n  See `issue 3 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/3>`_.\n\n- Make the internal singleton object returned by APIs like\n  ``implementedBy`` and ``directlyProvidedBy`` for objects that\n  implement or provide no interfaces more immutable. Previously an\n  internal cache could be mutated. See `issue 204\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/204>`_.\n\n5.0.2 (2020-03-30)\n==================\n\n- Ensure that objects that implement no interfaces (such as direct\n  subclasses of ``object``) still include ``Interface`` itself in\n  their ``__iro___`` and ``__sro___``. This fixes adapter registry\n  lookups for such objects when the adapter is registered for\n  ``Interface``. See `issue 197\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/197>`_.\n\n\n5.0.1 (2020-03-21)\n==================\n\n- Ensure the resolution order for ``InterfaceClass`` is consistent.\n  See `issue 192 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/192>`_.\n\n- Ensure the resolution order for ``collections.OrderedDict`` is\n  consistent on CPython 2. (It was already consistent on Python 3 and PyPy).\n\n- Fix the handling of the ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_IRO`` environment\n  variable. Previously, ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_RO`` was read, in\n  contrast with the documentation. See `issue 194\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/194>`_.\n\n\n5.0.0 (2020-03-19)\n==================\n\n- Make an internal singleton object returned by APIs like\n  ``implementedBy`` and ``directlyProvidedBy`` immutable. Previously,\n  it was fully mutable and allowed changing its ``__bases___``. That\n  could potentially lead to wrong results in pathological corner\n  cases. See `issue 158\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/158>`_.\n\n- Support the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable at runtime instead\n  of just at wheel build time. A value of 0 forces the C extensions to\n  be used (even on PyPy) failing if they aren't present. Any other\n  value forces the Python implementation to be used, ignoring the C\n  extensions. See `PR 151 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/151>`_.\n\n- Cache the result of ``__hash__`` method in ``InterfaceClass`` as a\n  speed optimization. The method is called very often (i.e several\n  hundred thousand times during Plone 5.2 startup). Because the hash value never\n  changes it can be cached. This improves test performance from 0.614s\n  down to 0.575s (1.07x faster). In a real world Plone case a reindex\n  index came down from 402s to 320s (1.26x faster). See `PR 156\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/156>`_.\n\n- Change the C classes ``SpecificationBase`` and its subclass\n  ``ClassProvidesBase`` to store implementation attributes in their structures\n  instead of their instance dictionaries. This eliminates the use of\n  an undocumented private C API function, and helps make some\n  instances require less memory. See `PR 154 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/154>`_.\n\n- Reduce memory usage in other ways based on observations of usage\n  patterns in Zope (3) and Plone code bases.\n\n  - Specifications with no dependents are common (more than 50%) so\n    avoid allocating a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` unless we need it.\n  - Likewise, tagged values are relatively rare, so don't allocate a\n    dictionary to hold them until they are used.\n  - Use ``__slots___`` or the C equivalent ``tp_members`` in more\n    common places. Note that this removes the ability to set arbitrary\n    instance variables on certain objects.\n    See `PR 155 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/155>`_.\n\n  The changes in this release resulted in a 7% memory reduction after\n  loading about 6,000 modules that define about 2,200 interfaces.\n\n  .. caution::\n\n     Details of many private attributes have changed, and external use\n     of those private attributes may break. In particular, the\n     lifetime and default value of ``_v_attrs`` has changed.\n\n- Remove support for hashing uninitialized interfaces. This could only\n  be done by subclassing ``InterfaceClass``. This has generated a\n  warning since it was first added in 2011 (3.6.5). Please call the\n  ``InterfaceClass`` constructor or otherwise set the appropriate\n  fields in your subclass before attempting to hash or sort it. See\n  `issue 157 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/157>`_.\n\n- Remove unneeded override of the ``__hash__`` method from\n  ``zope.interface.declarations.Implements``. Watching a reindex index\n  process in ZCatalog with on a Py-Spy after 10k samples the time for\n  ``.adapter._lookup`` was reduced from 27.5s to 18.8s (~1.5x faster).\n  Overall reindex index time shrunk from 369s to 293s (1.26x faster).\n  See `PR 161\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/161>`_.\n\n- Make the Python implementation closer to the C implementation by\n  ignoring all exceptions, not just ``AttributeError``, during (parts\n  of) interface adaptation. See `issue 163\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/163>`_.\n\n- Micro-optimization in ``.adapter._lookup`` , ``.adapter._lookupAll``\n  and ``.adapter._subscriptions``: By loading ``components.get`` into\n  a local variable before entering the loop a bytcode \"LOAD_FAST 0\n  (components)\" in the loop can be eliminated. In Plone, while running\n  all tests, average speedup of the \"owntime\" of ``_lookup`` is ~5x.\n  See `PR 167\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/167>`_.\n\n- Add ``__all__`` declarations to all modules. This helps tools that\n  do auto-completion and documentation and results in less cluttered\n  results. Wildcard (\"*\") are not recommended and may be affected. See\n  `issue 153\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/153>`_.\n\n- Fix ``verifyClass`` and ``verifyObject`` for builtin types like\n  ``dict`` that have methods taking an optional, unnamed argument with\n  no default value like ``dict.pop``. On PyPy3, the verification is\n  strict, but on PyPy2 (as on all versions of CPython) those methods\n  cannot be verified and are ignored. See `issue 118\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/118>`_.\n\n- Update the common interfaces ``IEnumerableMapping``,\n  ``IExtendedReadMapping``, ``IExtendedWriteMapping``,\n  ``IReadSequence`` and ``IUniqueMemberWriteSequence`` to no longer\n  require methods that were removed from Python 3 on Python 3, such as\n  ``__setslice___``. Now, ``dict``, ``list`` and ``tuple`` properly\n  verify as ``IFullMapping``, ``ISequence`` and ``IReadSequence,``\n  respectively on all versions of Python.\n\n- Add human-readable ``__str___`` and ``__repr___`` to ``Attribute``\n  and ``Method``. These contain the name of the defining interface\n  and the attribute. For methods, it also includes the signature.\n\n- Change the error strings raised by ``verifyObject`` and\n  ``verifyClass``. They now include more human-readable information\n  and exclude extraneous lines and spaces. See `issue 170\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/170>`_.\n\n  .. caution:: This will break consumers (such as doctests) that\n               depended on the exact error messages.\n\n- Make ``verifyObject`` and ``verifyClass`` report all errors, if the\n  candidate object has multiple detectable violations. Previously they\n  reported only the first error. See `issue\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/171>`_.\n\n  Like the above, this will break consumers depending on the exact\n  output of error messages if more than one error is present.\n\n- Add ``zope.interface.common.collections``,\n  ``zope.interface.common.numbers``, and ``zope.interface.common.io``.\n  These modules define interfaces based on the ABCs defined in the\n  standard library ``collections.abc``, ``numbers`` and ``io``\n  modules, respectively. Importing these modules will make the\n  standard library concrete classes that are registered with those\n  ABCs declare the appropriate interface. See `issue 138\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/138>`_.\n\n- Add ``zope.interface.common.builtins``. This module defines\n  interfaces of common builtin types, such as ``ITextString`` and\n  ``IByteString``, ``IDict``, etc. These interfaces extend the\n  appropriate interfaces from ``collections`` and ``numbers``, and the\n  standard library classes implement them after importing this module.\n  This is intended as a replacement for third-party packages like\n  `dolmen.builtins <https://pypi.org/project/dolmen.builtins/>`_.\n  See `issue 138 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/138>`_.\n\n- Make ``providedBy()`` and ``implementedBy()`` respect ``super``\n  objects. For instance, if class ``Derived`` implements ``IDerived``\n  and extends ``Base`` which in turn implements ``IBase``, then\n  ``providedBy(super(Derived, derived))`` will return ``[IBase]``.\n  Previously it would have returned ``[IDerived]`` (in general, it\n  would previously have returned whatever would have been returned\n  without ``super``).\n\n  Along with this change, adapter registries will unpack ``super``\n  objects into their ``__self___`` before passing it to the factory.\n  Together, this means that ``component.getAdapter(super(Derived,\n  self), ITarget)`` is now meaningful.\n\n  See `issue 11 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/11>`_.\n\n- Fix a potential interpreter crash in the low-level adapter\n  registry lookup functions. See issue 11.\n\n- Adopt Python's standard `C3 resolution order\n  <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>`_ to compute the\n  ``__iro__`` and ``__sro__`` of interfaces, with tweaks to support\n  additional cases that are common in interfaces but disallowed for\n  Python classes. Previously, an ad-hoc ordering that made no\n  particular guarantees was used.\n\n  This has many beneficial properties, including the fact that base\n  interface and base classes tend to appear near the end of the\n  resolution order instead of the beginning. The resolution order in\n  general should be more predictable and consistent.\n\n  .. caution::\n     In some cases, especially with complex interface inheritance\n     trees or when manually providing or implementing interfaces, the\n     resulting IRO may be quite different. This may affect adapter\n     lookup.\n\n  The C3 order enforces some constraints in order to be able to\n  guarantee a sensible ordering. Older versions of zope.interface did\n  not impose similar constraints, so it was possible to create\n  interfaces and declarations that are inconsistent with the C3\n  constraints. In that event, zope.interface will still produce a\n  resolution order equal to the old order, but it won't be guaranteed\n  to be fully C3 compliant. In the future, strict enforcement of C3\n  order may be the default.\n\n  A set of environment variables and module constants allows\n  controlling several aspects of this new behaviour. It is possible to\n  request warnings about inconsistent resolution orders encountered,\n  and even to forbid them. Differences between the C3 resolution order\n  and the previous order can be logged, and, in extreme cases, the\n  previous order can still be used (this ability will be removed in\n  the future). For details, see the documentation for\n  ``zope.interface.ro``.\n\n- Make inherited tagged values in interfaces respect the resolution\n  order (``__iro__``), as method and attribute lookup does. Previously\n  tagged values could give inconsistent results. See `issue 190\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/190>`_.\n\n- Add ``getDirectTaggedValue`` (and related methods) to interfaces to\n  allow accessing tagged values irrespective of inheritance. See\n  `issue 190\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/190>`_.\n\n- Ensure that ``Interface`` is always the last item in the ``__iro__``\n  and ``__sro__``. This is usually the case, but if classes that do\n  not implement any interfaces are part of a class inheritance\n  hierarchy, ``Interface`` could be assigned too high a priority.\n  See `issue 8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/8>`_.\n\n- Implement sorting, equality, and hashing in C for ``Interface``\n  objects. In micro benchmarks, this makes those operations 40% to 80%\n  faster. This translates to a 20% speed up in querying adapters.\n\n  Note that this changes certain implementation details. In\n  particular, ``InterfaceClass`` now has a non-default metaclass, and\n  it is enforced that ``__module__`` in instances of\n  ``InterfaceClass`` is read-only.\n\n  See `PR 183 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/183>`_.\n\n\n4.7.2 (2020-03-10)\n==================\n\n- Remove deprecated use of setuptools features.  See `issue 30\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/30>`_.\n\n\n4.7.1 (2019-11-11)\n==================\n\n- Use Python 3 syntax in the documentation.  See `issue 119\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/119>`_.\n\n\n4.7.0 (2019-11-11)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.4.\n\n- Change ``queryTaggedValue``, ``getTaggedValue``,\n  ``getTaggedValueTags`` in interfaces. They now include inherited\n  values by following ``__bases__``. See `PR 144\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/144>`_.\n\n  .. caution:: This may be a breaking change.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.8.\n\n\n4.6.0 (2018-10-23)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7\n\n- Fix ``verifyObject`` for class objects with staticmethods on\n  Python 3. See `issue 126\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/126>`_.\n\n\n4.5.0 (2018-04-19)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for 3.3, avoid accidental dependence breakage via setup.py.\n  See `PR 110 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/110>`_.\n- Allow registering and unregistering instance methods as listeners.\n  See `issue 12 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/12>`_\n  and `PR 102 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/102>`_.\n- Synchronize and simplify zope/__init__.py. See `issue 114\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/114>`_\n\n\n4.4.3 (2017-09-22)\n==================\n\n- Avoid exceptions when the ``__annotations__`` attribute is added to\n  interface definitions with Python 3.x type hints. See `issue 98\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/98>`_.\n- Fix the possibility of a rare crash in the C extension when\n  deallocating items. See `issue 100\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/100>`_.\n\n\n4.4.2 (2017-06-14)\n==================\n\n- Fix a regression storing\n  ``zope.component.persistentregistry.PersistentRegistry`` instances.\n  See `issue 85 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/85>`_.\n\n- Fix a regression that could lead to the utility registration cache\n  of ``Components`` getting out of sync. See `issue 93\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/93>`_.\n\n4.4.1 (2017-05-13)\n==================\n\n- Simplify the caching of utility-registration data. In addition to\n  simplification, avoids spurious test failures when checking for\n  leaks in tests with persistent registries. See `pull 84\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/84>`_.\n\n- Raise ``ValueError`` when non-text names are passed to adapter registry\n  methods:  prevents corruption of lookup caches.\n\n4.4.0 (2017-04-21)\n==================\n\n- Avoid a warning from the C compiler.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/71)\n\n- Add support for Python 3.6.\n\n4.3.3 (2016-12-13)\n==================\n\n- Correct typos and ReST formatting errors in documentation.\n\n- Add API documentation for the adapter registry.\n\n- Ensure that the ``LICENSE.txt`` file is included in built wheels.\n\n- Fix C optimizations broken on Py3k.  See the Python bug at:\n  http://bugs.python.org/issue15657\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/60)\n\n\n4.3.2 (2016-09-05)\n==================\n\n- Fix equality testing of ``implementedBy`` objects and proxies.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/55)\n\n\n4.3.1 (2016-08-31)\n==================\n\n- Support Components subclasses that are not hashable.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/53)\n\n\n4.3.0 (2016-08-31)\n==================\n\n- Add the ability to sort the objects returned by ``implementedBy``.\n  This is compatible with the way interface classes sort so they can\n  be used together in ordered containers like BTrees.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/42)\n\n- Make ``setuptools`` a hard dependency of ``setup.py``.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/13)\n\n- Change a linear algorithm (O(n)) in ``Components.registerUtility`` and\n  ``Components.unregisterUtility`` into a dictionary lookup (O(1)) for\n  hashable components. This substantially improves the time taken to\n  manipulate utilities in large registries at the cost of some\n  additional memory usage. (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/46)\n\n\n4.2.0 (2016-06-10)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.5\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.\n\n\n4.1.3 (2015-10-05)\n==================\n\n- Fix installation without a C compiler on Python 3.5\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/24).\n\n\n4.1.2 (2014-12-27)\n==================\n\n- Add support for PyPy3.\n\n- Remove unittest assertions deprecated in Python3.x.\n\n- Add ``zope.interface.document.asReStructuredText``, which formats the\n  generated text for an interface using ReST double-backtick markers.\n\n\n4.1.1 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.4.\n\n\n4.1.0 (2014-02-05)\n==================\n\n- Update ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.\n\n- Add ``@named(name)`` declaration, that specifies the component name, so it\n  does not have to be passed in during registration.\n\n\n4.0.5 (2013-02-28)\n==================\n\n- Fix a bug where a decorated method caused false positive failures on\n  ``verifyClass()``.\n\n\n4.0.4 (2013-02-21)\n==================\n\n- Fix a bug that was revealed by porting zope.traversing. During a loop, the\n  loop body modified a weakref dict causing a ``RuntimeError`` error.\n\n4.0.3 (2012-12-31)\n==================\n\n- Fleshed out PyPI Trove classifiers.\n\n4.0.2 (2012-11-21)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.3.\n\n- Restored ability to install the package in the absence of ``setuptools``.\n\n- LP #1055223:  Fix test which depended on dictionary order and failed randomly\n  in Python 3.3.\n\n4.0.1 (2012-05-22)\n==================\n\n- Drop explicit ``DeprecationWarnings`` for \"class advice\" APIS (these\n  APIs are still deprecated under Python 2.x, and still raise an exception\n  under Python 3.x, but no longer cause a warning to be emitted under\n  Python 2.x).\n\n4.0.0 (2012-05-16)\n==================\n\n- Automated build of Sphinx HTML docs and running doctest snippets via tox.\n\n- Deprecate the \"class advice\" APIs from ``zope.interface.declarations``:\n  ``implements``, ``implementsOnly``, and ``classProvides``.  In their place,\n  prefer the equivalent class decorators: ``@implementer``,\n  ``@implementer_only``, and ``@provider``.  Code which uses the deprecated\n  APIs will not work as expected under Py3k.\n\n- Remove use of '2to3' and associated fixers when installing under Py3k.\n  The code is now in a \"compatible subset\" which supports Python 2.6, 2.7,\n  and 3.2, including PyPy 1.8 (the version compatible with the 2.7 language\n  spec).\n\n- Drop explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5 / 3.1.\n\n- Add support for PyPy.\n\n- Add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- Add 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n- Add 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- Replace all unittest coverage previously accomplished via doctests with\n  unittests.  The doctests have been moved into a ``docs`` section, managed\n  as a Sphinx collection.\n\n- LP #910987:  Ensure that the semantics of the ``lookup`` method of\n  ``zope.interface.adapter.LookupBase`` are the same in both the C and\n  Python implementations.\n\n- LP #900906:  Avoid exceptions due to tne new ``__qualname__`` attribute\n  added in Python 3.3 (see PEP 3155 for rationale).  Thanks to Antoine\n  Pitrou for the patch.\n\n3.8.0 (2011-09-22)\n==================\n\n- New module ``zope.interface.registry``.  This is code moved from\n  ``zope.component.registry`` which implements a basic nonperistent component\n  registry as ``zope.interface.registry.Components``.  This class was moved\n  from ``zope.component`` to make porting systems (such as Pyramid) that rely\n  only on a basic component registry to Python 3 possible without needing to\n  port the entirety of the ``zope.component`` package.  Backwards\n  compatibility import shims have been left behind in ``zope.component``, so\n  this change will not break any existing code.\n\n- New ``tests_require`` dependency: ``zope.event`` to test events sent by\n  Components implementation.  The ``zope.interface`` package does not have a\n  hard dependency on ``zope.event``, but if ``zope.event`` is importable, it\n  will send component registration events when methods of an instance of\n  ``zope.interface.registry.Components`` are called.\n\n- New interfaces added to support ``zope.interface.registry.Components``\n  addition: ``ComponentLookupError``, ``Invalid``, ``IObjectEvent``,\n  ``ObjectEvent``, ``IComponentLookup``, ``IRegistration``,\n  ``IUtilityRegistration``, ``IAdapterRegistration``,\n  ``ISubscriptionAdapterRegistration``, ``IHandlerRegistration``,\n  ``IRegistrationEvent``, ``RegistrationEvent``, ``IRegistered``,\n  ``Registered``, ``IUnregistered``, ``Unregistered``,\n  ``IComponentRegistry``, and ``IComponents``.\n\n- No longer Python 2.4 compatible (tested under 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2).\n\n3.7.0 (2011-08-13)\n==================\n\n- Move changes from 3.6.2 - 3.6.5 to a new 3.7.x release line.\n\n3.6.7 (2011-08-20)\n==================\n\n- Fix sporadic failures on x86-64 platforms in tests of rich comparisons\n  of interfaces.\n\n3.6.6 (2011-08-13)\n==================\n\n- LP #570942:  Now correctly compare interfaces  from different modules but\n  with the same names.\n\n  N.B.: This is a less intrusive / destabilizing fix than the one applied in\n  3.6.3:  we only fix the underlying cmp-alike function, rather than adding\n  the other \"rich comparison\" functions.\n\n- Revert to software as released with 3.6.1 for \"stable\" 3.6 release branch.\n\n3.6.5 (2011-08-11)\n==================\n\n- LP #811792:  work around buggy behavior in some subclasses of\n  ``zope.interface.interface.InterfaceClass``, which invoke ``__hash__``\n  before initializing ``__module__`` and ``__name__``.  The workaround\n  returns a fixed constant hash in such cases, and issues a ``UserWarning``.\n\n- LP #804832:  Under PyPy, ``zope.interface`` should not build its C\n  extension.  Also, prevent attempting to build it under Jython.\n\n- Add a tox.ini for easier xplatform testing.\n\n- Fix testing deprecation warnings issued when tested under Py3K.\n\n3.6.4 (2011-07-04)\n==================\n\n- LP 804951:  InterfaceClass instances were unhashable under Python 3.x.\n\n3.6.3 (2011-05-26)\n==================\n\n- LP #570942:  Now correctly compare interfaces  from different modules but\n  with the same names.\n\n3.6.2 (2011-05-17)\n==================\n\n- Moved detailed documentation out-of-line from PyPI page, linking instead to\n  http://docs.zope.org/zope.interface .\n\n- Fixes for small issues when running tests under Python 3.2 using\n  ``zope.testrunner``.\n\n- LP # 675064:  Specify return value type for C optimizations module init\n  under Python 3:  undeclared value caused warnings, and segfaults on some\n  64 bit architectures.\n\n- setup.py now raises RuntimeError if you don't have Distutils installed when\n  running under Python 3.\n\n3.6.1 (2010-05-03)\n==================\n\n- A non-ASCII character in the changelog made 3.6.0 uninstallable on\n  Python 3 systems with another default encoding than UTF-8.\n\n- Fix compiler warnings under GCC 4.3.3.\n\n3.6.0 (2010-04-29)\n==================\n\n- LP #185974:  Clear the cache used by ``Specificaton.get`` inside\n  ``Specification.changed``.  Thanks to Jacob Holm for the patch.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.1. Contributors:\n\n    Lennart Regebro\n    Martin v Loewis\n    Thomas Lotze\n    Wolfgang Schnerring\n\n  The 3.1 support is completely backwards compatible. However, the implements\n  syntax used under Python 2.X does not work under 3.X, since it depends on\n  how metaclasses are implemented and this has changed. Instead it now supports\n  a decorator syntax (also under Python 2.X)::\n\n    class Foo:\n        implements(IFoo)\n        ...\n\n  can now also be written::\n\n    @implementer(IFoo):\n    class Foo:\n        ...\n\n  There are 2to3 fixers available to do this change automatically in the\n  zope.fixers package.\n\n- Python 2.3 is no longer supported.\n\n\n3.5.4 (2009-12-23)\n==================\n\n- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which\n  has been deprecated.\n\n\n3.5.3 (2009-12-08)\n==================\n\n- Fix an edge case: make providedBy() work when a class has '__provides__' in\n  its __slots__ (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.devel/22490)\n\n\n3.5.2 (2009-07-01)\n==================\n\n- BaseAdapterRegistry.unregister, unsubscribe: Remove empty portions of\n  the data structures when something is removed.  This avoids leaving\n  references to global objects (interfaces) that may be slated for\n  removal from the calling application.\n\n\n3.5.1 (2009-03-18)\n==================\n\n- verifyObject: use getattr instead of hasattr to test for object attributes\n  in order to let exceptions other than AttributeError raised by properties\n  propagate to the caller\n\n- Add Sphinx-based documentation building to the package buildout\n  configuration. Use the ``bin/docs`` command after buildout.\n\n- Improve package description a bit. Unify changelog entries formatting.\n\n- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as\n  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.\n\n\n3.5.0 (2008-10-26)\n==================\n\n- Fix declaration of _zope_interface_coptimizations, it's not a top level\n  package.\n\n- Add a DocTestSuite for odd.py module, so their tests are run.\n\n- Allow to bootstrap on Jython.\n\n- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/3.3/+bug/98388: ISpecification\n  was missing a declaration for __iro__.\n\n- Add optional code optimizations support, which allows the building\n  of C code optimizations to fail (Jython).\n\n- Replace `_flatten` with a non-recursive implementation, effectively making\n  it 3x faster.\n\n\n3.4.1 (2007-10-02)\n==================\n\n- Fix a setup bug that prevented installation from source on systems\n  without setuptools.\n\n\n3.4.0 (2007-07-19)\n==================\n\n- Final release for 3.4.0.\n\n\n3.4.0b3 (2007-05-22)\n====================\n\n\n- When checking whether an object is already registered, use identity\n  comparison, to allow adding registering with picky custom comparison methods.\n\n\n3.3.0.1 (2007-01-03)\n====================\n\n- Made a reference to OverflowWarning, which disappeared in Python\n  2.5, conditional.\n\n\n3.3.0 (2007/01/03)\n==================\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Refactor the adapter-lookup algorithim to make it much simpler and faster.\n\n  Also, implement more of the adapter-lookup logic in C, making\n  debugging of application code easier, since there is less\n  infrastructre code to step through.\n\n- Treat objects without interface declarations as if they\n  declared that they provide ``zope.interface.Interface``.\n\n- Add a number of richer new adapter-registration interfaces\n  that provide greater control and introspection.\n\n- Add a new interface decorator to zope.interface that allows the\n  setting of tagged values on an interface at definition time (see\n  zope.interface.taggedValue).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- A bug in multi-adapter lookup sometimes caused incorrect adapters to\n  be returned.\n\n\n3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)\n====================\n\n- Fix packaging bug:  'package_dir' must be a *relative* path.\n\n\n3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)\n====================\n\n- Packaging change:  suppress inclusion of 'setup.cfg' in 'sdist' builds.\n\n\n3.2.0 (2006-01-05)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope 3.2.0 release.\n\n\n3.1.0 (2005-10-03)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope 3.1.0 release.\n\n- Made attribute resolution order consistent with component lookup order,\n  i.e. new-style class MRO semantics.\n\n- Deprecate 'isImplementedBy' and 'isImplementedByInstancesOf' APIs in\n  favor of 'implementedBy' and 'providedBy'.\n\n\n3.0.1 (2005-07-27)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope X3.0.1 release.\n\n- Fix a bug reported by James Knight, which caused adapter registries\n  to fail occasionally to reflect declaration changes.\n\n\n3.0.0 (2004-11-07)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope X3.0.0 release.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/cd/37/1b003190ba7148226a8212d98ff8074e212fef30c82e616bdb818ae1f838/zope.interface-6.2.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Zope Public License (ZPL) Version 2.1\n\nA copyright notice accompanies this license document that identifies the\ncopyright holders.\n\nThis license has been certified as open source.

This means doing file IO may interfere with asyncio applications,\nwhich shouldn't block the executing thread. aiofiles helps with this by\nintroducing asynchronous versions of files that support delegating operations to\na separate thread pool.\n\n```python\nasync with aiofiles.open('filename', mode='r') as f:\n    contents = await f.read()\nprint(contents)\n'My file contents'\n```\n\nAsynchronous iteration is also supported.\n\n```python\nasync with aiofiles.open('filename') as f:\n    async for line in f:\n        ...\n```\n\nAsynchronous interface to tempfile module.\n\n```python\nasync with aiofiles.tempfile.TemporaryFile('wb') as f:\n    await f.write(b'Hello, World!')\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- a file API very similar to Python's standard, blocking API\n- support for buffered and unbuffered binary files, and buffered text files\n- support for `async`/`await` ([PEP 492](https://peps.python.org/pep-0492/)) constructs\n- async interface to tempfile module\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install aiofiles, simply:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install aiofiles\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFiles are opened using the `aiofiles.open()` coroutine, which in addition to\nmirroring the builtin `open` accepts optional `loop` and `executor`\narguments. If `loop` is absent, the default loop will be used, as per the\nset asyncio policy. If `executor` is not specified, the default event loop\nexecutor will be used.\n\nIn case of success, an asynchronous file object is returned with an\nAPI identical to an ordinary file, except the following methods are coroutines\nand delegate to an executor:\n\n- `close`\n- `flush`\n- `isatty`\n- `read`\n- `readall`\n- `read1`\n- `readinto`\n- `readline`\n- `readlines`\n- `seek`\n- `seekable`\n- `tell`\n- `truncate`\n- `writable`\n- `write`\n- `writelines`\n\nIn case of failure, one of the usual exceptions will be raised.\n\n`aiofiles.stdin`, `aiofiles.stdout`, `aiofiles.stderr`,\n`aiofiles.stdin_bytes`, `aiofiles.stdout_bytes`, and\n`aiofiles.stderr_bytes` provide async access to `sys.stdin`,\n`sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`, and their corresponding `.buffer` properties.\n\nThe `aiofiles.os` module contains executor-enabled coroutine versions of\nseveral useful `os` functions that deal with files:\n\n- `stat`\n- `statvfs`\n- `sendfile`\n- `rename`\n- `renames`\n- `replace`\n- `remove`\n- `unlink`\n- `mkdir`\n- `makedirs`\n- `rmdir`\n- `removedirs`\n- `link`\n- `symlink`\n- `readlink`\n- `listdir`\n- `scandir`\n- `access`\n- `path.exists`\n- `path.isfile`\n- `path.isdir`\n- `path.islink`\n- `path.ismount`\n- `path.getsize`\n- `path.getatime`\n- `path.getctime`\n- `path.samefile`\n- `path.sameopenfile`\n\n### Tempfile\n\n**aiofiles.tempfile** implements the following interfaces:\n\n- TemporaryFile\n- NamedTemporaryFile\n- SpooledTemporaryFile\n- TemporaryDirectory\n\nResults return wrapped with a context manager allowing use with async with and async for.\n\n```python\nasync with aiofiles.tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('wb+') as f:\n    await f.write(b'Line1\\n Line2')\n    await f.seek(0)\n    async for line in f:\n        print(line)\n\nasync with aiofiles.tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:\n    filename = os.path.join(d, \"file.ext\")\n```\n\n### Writing tests for aiofiles\n\nReal file IO can be mocked by patching `aiofiles.threadpool.sync_open`\nas desired. The return type also needs to be registered with the\n`aiofiles.threadpool.wrap` dispatcher:\n\n```python\naiofiles.threadpool.wrap.register(mock.MagicMock)(\n    lambda *args, **kwargs: threadpool.AsyncBufferedIOBase(*args, **kwargs))\n\nasync def test_stuff():\n    data = 'data'\n    mock_file = mock.MagicMock()\n\n    with mock.patch('aiofiles.threadpool.sync_open', return_value=mock_file) as mock_open:\n        async with aiofiles.open('filename', 'w') as f:\n            await f.write(data)\n\n        mock_file.write.assert_called_once_with(data)\n```\n\n### History\n\n#### 23.2.1 (2023-08-09)\n\n- Import `os.statvfs` conditionally to fix importing on non-UNIX systems.\n  [#171](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/issues/171) [#172](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/172)\n\n#### 23.2.0 (2023-08-09)\n\n- aiofiles is now tested on Python 3.12 too.\n  [#166](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/issues/166) [#168](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/168)\n- On Python 3.12, `aiofiles.tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` now accepts a `delete_on_close` argument, just like the stdlib version.\n- On Python 3.12, `aiofiles.tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` no longer exposes a `delete` attribute, just like the stdlib version.\n- Added `aiofiles.os.statvfs` and `aiofiles.os.path.ismount`.\n  [#162](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/162)\n- Use [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) instead of Poetry.\n  [#169](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/169)\n\n#### 23.1.0 (2023-02-09)\n\n- Added `aiofiles.os.access`.\n  [#146](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/146)\n- Removed `aiofiles.tempfile.temptypes.AsyncSpooledTemporaryFile.softspace`.\n  [#151](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/151)\n- Added `aiofiles.stdin`, `aiofiles.stdin_bytes`, and other stdio streams.\n  [#154](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/154)\n- Transition to `asyncio.get_running_loop` (vs `asyncio.get_event_loop`) internally.\n\n#### 22.1.0 (2022-09-04)\n\n- Added `aiofiles.os.path.islink`.\n  [#126](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/126)\n- Added `aiofiles.os.readlink`.\n  [#125](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/125)\n- Added `aiofiles.os.symlink`.\n  [#124](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/124)\n- Added `aiofiles.os.unlink`.\n  [#123](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/123)\n- Added `aiofiles.os.link`.\n  [#121](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/121)\n- Added `aiofiles.os.renames`.\n  [#120](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/120)\n- Added `aiofiles.os.{listdir, scandir}`.\n  [#143](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/143)\n- Switched to CalVer.\n- Dropped Python 3.6 support.

See https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation for installation notes. Also note, that `lz4` compression libraries for python will require `python-dev` package,\nor python source header files for compilation on Linux.\nNOTE: You will also need a valid java installation. It's required for the ``keytool`` utility, used to\ngenerate ssh keys for some tests.\n\nSetting up tests requirements (assuming you're within virtualenv on ubuntu 14.04+)::\n\n    sudo apt-get install -y libsnappy-dev libzstd-dev libkrb5-dev krb5-user\n    make setup\n\nRunning tests with coverage::\n\n    make cov\n\nTo run tests with a specific version of Kafka (default one is 1.0.2) use KAFKA_VERSION variable::\n\n    make cov KAFKA_VERSION=0.10.2.1\n\nTest running cheatsheat:\n\n * ``make test FLAGS=\"-l -x --ff\"`` - run until 1 failure, rerun failed tests first. Great for cleaning up a lot of errors, say after a big refactor.\n * ``make test FLAGS=\"-k consumer\"`` - run only the consumer tests.\n * ``make test FLAGS=\"-m 'not ssl'\"`` - run tests excluding ssl.\n * ``make test FLAGS=\"--no-pull\"`` - do not try to pull new docker image before test run.\n\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7c/f9/085b37eb3819556713a7cfc9f3b3f7a2c3c1bc0c8f2809b230c7f00ee26c/aiokafka-0.10.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

[One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).\n* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *\n* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *\n* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title=\"also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense\">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.\n* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.\n* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.\n* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.\n* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href=\"https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">JSON Schema</a>.\n\n<small>* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.</small>\n\n## Sponsors\n\n<!-- sponsors -->\n\n<a href=\"https://cryptapi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CryptAPI: Your easy to use, secure and privacy oriented payment gateway.\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/cryptapi.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://platform.sh/try-it-now/?utm_source=fastapi-signup&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=FastAPI-signup-June-2023\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Build, run and scale your apps on a modern, reliable, and secure PaaS.\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/platform-sh.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.porter.run\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Deploy FastAPI on AWS with a few clicks\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/porter.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://bump.sh/fastapi?utm_source=fastapi&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sponsor\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Automate FastAPI documentation generation with Bump.sh\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/bump-sh.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://reflex.dev\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reflex\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/reflex.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/scalar/scalar/?utm_source=fastapi&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main-badge\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Scalar: Beautiful Open-Source API References from Swagger/OpenAPI files\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/scalar.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.propelauth.com/?utm_source=fastapi&utm_campaign=1223&utm_medium=mainbadge\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Auth, user management and more for your B2B product\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/propelauth.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.withcoherence.com/?utm_medium=advertising&utm_source=fastapi&utm_campaign=banner%20january%2024\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Coherence\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/coherence.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/python/python-quickstart-fastapi/?utm_campaign=fastapi_framework&utm_source=fastapi_sponsorship&utm_medium=web_referral\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Simplify Full Stack Development with FastAPI & MongoDB\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/mongodb.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://training.talkpython.fm/fastapi-courses\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FastAPI video courses on demand from people you trust\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/talkpython-v2.jpg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Build powerful search from composable, open source building blocks\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/haystack-fastapi.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://databento.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pay as you go for market data\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/databento.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://speakeasyapi.dev?utm_source=fastapi+repo&utm_medium=github+sponsorship\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SDKs for your API | Speakeasy\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/speakeasy.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.svix.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Svix - Webhooks as a service\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/svix.svg\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.codacy.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsors&utm_id=pioneers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Take code reviews from hours to minutes\"><img src=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/sponsors/codacy.png\"></a>\n\n<!-- /sponsors -->\n\n<a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#sponsors\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Other sponsors</a>\n\n## Opinions\n\n\"_[...] I'm using **FastAPI** a ton these days.

If you are viewing this document on gevent.org, it\n   refers to the current state of gevent in source control (git\n   master).\n\nSupported Platforms\n===================\n\nThis version of gevent runs on Python 3.8 and up, (for exact details\nof tested versions, see the classifiers on the PyPI page or in\n``setup.py``). gevent requires the `greenlet\n<https://greenlet.readthedocs.io>`_ library and will install the\n`cffi`_ library by default on Windows. The cffi library will become\nthe default on all platforms in a future release of gevent.\n\nThis version of gevent is also tested on on PyPy 3.10 (7.3.12); it\nshould run on PyPy 3.9 and above. On PyPy, there are no external\ndependencies.\n\ngevent is tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and should run on most\nother Unix-like operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.)\n\n.. note::\n\n   Windows is supported as a tier 2, \"best effort,\" platform. It is\n   suitable for development, but not recommended for production. In\n   particular, PyPy3 on Windows may have issues, especially with\n   subprocesses.\n\n   On Windows using the deprecated libev backend, gevent is\n   limited to a maximum of 1024 open sockets due to\n   `limitations in libev`_. This limitation should not exist\n   with the default libuv backend.\n\nOlder Versions of Python\n------------------------\n\nUsers of older versions of Python 2 or Python 3 may install an older\nversion of gevent. Note that these versions are generally not\nsupported.\n\n+-------+-------+\n|Python |Gevent |\n|Version|Version|\n+=======+=======+\n|2.5    |1.0.x  |\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|2.6    |1.1.x  |\n+-------+-------+\n|<=     |1.2.x  |\n|2.7.8  |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|3.3    |1.2.x  |\n+-------+-------+\n|3.4.0 -| 1.3.x |\n|3.4.2  |       |\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|3.4.3  | 1.4.x |\n|       |       |\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|3.5.x  | 20.9.0|\n|       |       |\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n|2.7.9 -|       |\n|2.7.18,| 22.10 |\n|3.6,   |       |\n|3.7    |       |\n|       |       |\n+-------+-------+\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n.. note::\n\n   This section is about installing released versions of gevent as\n   distributed on the `Python Package Index`_. For building gevent\n   from source, including customizing the build and embedded\n   libraries, see `Installing From Source`_.\n\n.. _Python Package Index: http://pypi.org/project/gevent\n\ngevent and greenlet can both be installed with `pip`_, e.g., ``pip\ninstall gevent``. Installation using `buildout\n<http://docs.buildout.org/en/latest/>`_ is also supported.\n\nOn Windows, macOS, and Linux, both gevent and greenlet are\ndistributed as binary `wheels`_.\n\n.. tip::\n\n   You need Pip 8.0 or later, or buildout 2.10.0 to install the binary\n   wheels on Windows or macOS. On Linux, you'll need `pip 19\n   <https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5008>`_ to install the\n   manylinux2010 wheels.\n\n.. tip::\n\n   While the x86-64 binaries are considered production quality, they\n   are built with relatively low optimization levels and no hardware\n   specific optimizations. Serious production users are encouraged to\n   install from source with appropriate compiler flags.\n\n.. tip::\n\n   Beginning with gevent 20.12.0, 64-bit ARM binaries are distributed\n   on PyPI for aarch64 manylinux2014 compatible systems. Installing these\n   needs a very recent version of ``pip``. These wheels *do not*\n   contain the c-ares resolver, are not tested, and are built with\n   very low levels of optimizations. Serious production users of\n   gevent on 64-bit ARM systems are encouraged to build their own\n   binary wheels.\n\n   Beginning with gevent 22.10.0, ppc64le binaries are distributed on\n   PyPI. The same caveats apply as for 64-bit ARM binaries. Using them\n   for anything other than local development is discouraged.\n\n   Beginning with gevent 23, muslinux aarch64 and S390X binaries\n   are distributed on PyPI. The same caveats apply as for 64-bit ARM\n   binaries. Using them for anything other than local development is\n   discouraged.\n\n\nInstalling From Source\n----------------------\n\nIf you are unable to use the binary wheels (for platforms where no\npre-built wheels are available or if wheel installation is disabled),\nyou can build gevent from source. A normal ``pip install`` will\nfall back to doing this if no binary wheel is available. See\n`Installing From Source`_ for more, including common installation issues.\n\nExtra Dependencies\n==================\n\nThere are a number\nof additional libraries that extend gevent's functionality and will be\nused if they are available. All of these may be installed using\n`setuptools extras\n<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies>`_,\nas named below, e.g., ``pip install gevent[events]``.\n\nevents\n    In versions of gevent up to and including 20.5.0, this provided configurable\n    event support using `zope.event\n    <https://pypi.org/project/zope.event>`_ and was highly\n    recommended.\n\n    In versions after that, this extra is empty and does nothing. It\n    will be removed in gevent 21.0.\n\ndnspython\n    Enables a pure-Python resolver, backed by `dnspython\n    <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython>`_. On Python 2, this also\n    includes `idna <https://pypi.org/project/idna>`_. They can be\n    installed with the ``dnspython`` extra.\n\n    .. note:: This is not compatible with Python 3.10+ or dnspython 2.\n\nmonitor\n    Enhancements to gevent's self-monitoring capabilities. This\n    includes the `psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil>`_ library\n    which is needed to monitor memory usage. (Note that this may not\n    build on all platforms.)\n\nrecommended\n    A shortcut for installing suggested extras together. This includes\n    the non-test extras defined here, plus additions that improve\n    gevent's operation on certain platforms (for example, in the past,\n    it has included backports of newer APIs).\n\ntest\n    Everything needed to run the complete gevent test suite.\n\n\n.. _`pip`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/\n.. _`wheels`: http://pythonwheels.com\n.. _`gevent 1.5`: whatsnew_1_5.html\n.. _`Installing From Source`: https://www.gevent.org/development/installing_from_source.html\n\n.. _`cffi`: https://cffi.readthedocs.io\n.. _`limitations in libev`: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#WIN32_PLATFORM_LIMITATIONS_AND_WORKA\n\n\n.. _bug tracker: https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues\n.. _mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/gevent\n.. _blog: https://dev.nextthought.com/blog/categories/gevent.html\n.. _twitter (@gevent): http://twitter.com/gevent\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/27/24/a3a7b713acfcf1177207f49ec25c665123f8972f42bee641bcc9f32961f4/gevent-24.2.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"MIT License\n\nExcept when otherwise stated (look at the beginning of each file) the software\nand the documentation in this project are copyrighted by:\n\n  Denis Bilenko and the contributors, http://www.gevent.org\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \"Licensor.\" Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

License Grants and Conditions\n      2.1. Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.","name":"MPL-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2016 Google Inc. .

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   k.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6.

Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to sell and import'') the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations\n   3. Distribution Obligations.\n      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n         (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n         (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Application of this License.\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n   6. Versions of the License.\n      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n         [1] A Developer specific license.\n         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n   8. TERMINATION.\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.","name":"OPL-1.0"}],"notes":[],"otherLicenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright 2022-2023 Intel Corporation\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.","name":"Apache-2.0"},{"attribution":"Copyright (c) 2022 Intel Corporation\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n   d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   g.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations.

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n      2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d.

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.","name":"GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception"},{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 2011-2014 The OpenBLAS Project\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 3 or any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d.

REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS\n\nThe Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.\n\nProper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:\n\n    Copyright (c) <year> by <author's name or designee>. This material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).\n\nThe reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).\n\nCommercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is permitted.\n\nAny publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title.\n\n\nII. COPYRIGHT\n\nThe copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee.\n\n\nIII. SCOPE OF LICENSE\n\nThe following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.\n\nMere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and appropriate copyright notice.\n\nSEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force.\n\nNO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.\n\n\nIV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS\n\nAll modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements:\n\n   1. The modified version must be labeled as such.\n   2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated.\n   3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices.\n   4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified.\n   5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author's (or authors') permission. \n\n\nV. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:\n\n   1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document.\n   2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document.\n   3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s). \n\n\nVI. LICENSE OPTIONS\n\nThe author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.\n\nA. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions without the explicit permission of the author(s). \"Substantive modification\" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical corrections.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\nB. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.\n\nTo accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.\n\n\nOPEN PUBLICATION POLICY APPENDIX:\n\n(This is not considered part of the license.)\n\nOpen Publication works are available in source format via the Open Publication home page at http://works.opencontent.org/.\n\nOpen Publication authors who want to include their own license on Open Publication works may do so, as long as their terms are not more restrictive than the Open Publication license.\n\nIf you have questions about the Open Publication License, please contact David Wiley, and/or the Open Publication Authors' List at opal@opencontent.org, via email.\n\nTo subscribe to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"subscribe\" in the body.\n\nTo post to the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal@opencontent.org or simply reply to a previous post.\n\nTo unsubscribe from the Open Publication Authors' List:\nSend E-mail to opal-request@opencontent.org with the word \"unsubscribe\" in the body.","name":"openpub"},{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 1993 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Subclasses of `str`,\r\n`int`, `dict`, and `list` are now serialized. This is faster and more similar\r\nto the standard library. It can be disabled with\r\n`orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS`.`dataclasses.dataclass` instances\r\nare now serialized by default and cannot be customized in a\r\n`default` function unless `option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATACLASS` is\r\nspecified. `uuid.UUID` instances are serialized by default.\r\nFor any type that is now serialized,\r\nimplementations in a `default` function and options enabling them can be\r\nremoved but do not need to be. There was no change in deserialization.\r\n\r\nTo migrate from the standard library, the largest difference is that\r\n`orjson.dumps` returns `bytes` and `json.dumps` returns a `str`. Users with\r\n`dict` objects using non-`str` keys should specify\r\n`option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS`. `sort_keys` is replaced by\r\n`option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS`. `indent` is replaced by\r\n`option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2` and other levels of indentation are not\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n### Serialize\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef dumps(\r\n    __obj: Any,\r\n    default: Optional[Callable[[Any], Any]] = ...,\r\n    option: Optional[int] = ...,\r\n) -> bytes: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dumps()` serializes Python objects to JSON.\r\n\r\nIt natively serializes\r\n`str`, `dict`, `list`, `tuple`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`,\r\n`dataclasses.dataclass`, `typing.TypedDict`, `datetime.datetime`,\r\n`datetime.date`, `datetime.time`, `uuid.UUID`, `numpy.ndarray`, and\r\n`orjson.Fragment` instances. It supports arbitrary types through `default`. It\r\nserializes subclasses of `str`, `int`, `dict`, `list`,\r\n`dataclasses.dataclass`, and `enum.Enum`. It does not serialize subclasses\r\nof `tuple` to avoid serializing `namedtuple` objects as arrays. To avoid\r\nserializing subclasses, specify the option `orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS`.\r\n\r\nThe output is a `bytes` object containing UTF-8.\r\n\r\nThe global interpreter lock (GIL) is held for the duration of the call.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError` on an unsupported type. This exception message\r\ndescribes the invalid object with the error message\r\n`Type is not JSON serializable: ...`. To fix this, specify\r\n[default](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#default).\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError` on a `str` that contains invalid UTF-8.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError` on an integer that exceeds 64 bits by default or,\r\nwith `OPT_STRICT_INTEGER`, 53 bits.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError` if a `dict` has a key of a type other than `str`,\r\nunless `OPT_NON_STR_KEYS` is specified.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError` if the output of `default` recurses to handling by\r\n`default` more than 254 levels deep.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError` on circular references.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONEncodeError`  if a `tzinfo` on a datetime object is\r\nunsupported.\r\n\r\n`JSONEncodeError` is a subclass of `TypeError`. This is for compatibility\r\nwith the standard library.\r\n\r\nIf the failure was caused by an exception in `default` then\r\n`JSONEncodeError` chains the original exception as `__cause__`.\r\n\r\n#### default\r\n\r\nTo serialize a subclass or arbitrary types, specify `default` as a\r\ncallable that returns a supported type. `default` may be a function,\r\nlambda, or callable class instance. To specify that a type was not\r\nhandled by `default`, raise an exception such as `TypeError`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, decimal\r\n>>>\r\ndef default(obj):\r\n    if isinstance(obj, decimal.Decimal):\r\n        return str(obj)\r\n    raise TypeError\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(decimal.Decimal(\"0.0842389659712649442845\"))\r\nJSONEncodeError: Type is not JSON serializable: decimal.Decimal\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(decimal.Decimal(\"0.0842389659712649442845\"), default=default)\r\nb'\"0.0842389659712649442845\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({1, 2}, default=default)\r\norjson.JSONEncodeError: Type is not JSON serializable: set\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `default` callable may return an object that itself\r\nmust be handled by `default` up to 254 times before an exception\r\nis raised.\r\n\r\nIt is important that `default` raise an exception if a type cannot be handled.\r\nPython otherwise implicitly returns `None`, which appears to the caller\r\nlike a legitimate value and is serialized:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, json, rapidjson\r\n>>>\r\ndef default(obj):\r\n    if isinstance(obj, decimal.Decimal):\r\n        return str(obj)\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"set\":{1, 2}}, default=default)\r\nb'{\"set\":null}'\r\n>>> json.dumps({\"set\":{1, 2}}, default=default)\r\n'{\"set\":null}'\r\n>>> rapidjson.dumps({\"set\":{1, 2}}, default=default)\r\n'{\"set\":null}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### option\r\n\r\nTo modify how data is serialized, specify `option`. Each `option` is an integer\r\nconstant in `orjson`. To specify multiple options, mask them together, e.g.,\r\n`option=orjson.OPT_STRICT_INTEGER | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC`.\r\n\r\n##### OPT_APPEND_NEWLINE\r\n\r\nAppend `\\n` to the output. This is a convenience and optimization for the\r\npattern of `dumps(...) + \"\\n\"`. `bytes` objects are immutable and this\r\npattern copies the original contents.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>> orjson.dumps([])\r\nb\"[]\"\r\n>>> orjson.dumps([], option=orjson.OPT_APPEND_NEWLINE)\r\nb\"[]\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### OPT_INDENT_2\r\n\r\nPretty-print output with an indent of two spaces. This is equivalent to\r\n`indent=2` in the standard library. Pretty printing is slower and the output\r\nlarger. orjson is the fastest compared library at pretty printing and has\r\nmuch less of a slowdown to pretty print than the standard library does. This\r\noption is compatible with all other options.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": {\"d\": True}, \"e\": [1, 2]})\r\nb'{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":{\"d\":true},\"e\":[1,2]}'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n    {\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": {\"d\": True}, \"e\": [1, 2]},\r\n    option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2\r\n)\r\nb'{\\n  \"a\": \"b\",\\n  \"c\": {\\n    \"d\": true\\n  },\\n  \"e\": [\\n    1,\\n    2\\n  ]\\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf displayed, the indentation and linebreaks appear like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"a\": \"b\",\r\n  \"c\": {\r\n    \"d\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"e\": [\r\n    1,\r\n    2\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis measures serializing the github.json fixture as compact (52KiB) or\r\npretty (64KiB):\r\n\r\n| Library    |   compact (ms) |   pretty (ms) |   vs. orjson |\r\n|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|\r\n| orjson     |           0.03 |          0.04 |          1   |\r\n| ujson      |           0.18 |          0.19 |          4.6 |\r\n| rapidjson  |           0.1  |          0.12 |          2.9 |\r\n| simplejson |           0.25 |          0.89 |         21.4 |\r\n| json       |           0.18 |          0.71 |         17   |\r\n\r\nThis measures serializing the citm_catalog.json fixture, more of a worst\r\ncase due to the amount of nesting and newlines, as compact (489KiB) or\r\npretty (1.1MiB):\r\n\r\n| Library    |   compact (ms) |   pretty (ms) |   vs. orjson |\r\n|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|\r\n| orjson     |           0.59 |          0.71 |          1   |\r\n| ujson      |           2.9  |          3.59 |          5   |\r\n| rapidjson  |           1.81 |          2.8  |          3.9 |\r\n| simplejson |          10.43 |         42.13 |         59.1 |\r\n| json       |           4.16 |         33.42 |         46.9 |\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced using the `pyindent` script.\r\n\r\n##### OPT_NAIVE_UTC\r\n\r\nSerialize `datetime.datetime` objects without a `tzinfo` as UTC. This\r\nhas no effect on `datetime.datetime` objects that have `tzinfo` set.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),\r\n    )\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC,\r\n    )\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### OPT_NON_STR_KEYS\r\n\r\nSerialize `dict` keys of type other than `str`. This allows `dict` keys\r\nto be one of `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`, `datetime.datetime`,\r\n`datetime.date`, `datetime.time`, `enum.Enum`, and `uuid.UUID`. For comparison,\r\nthe standard library serializes `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` or `None` by\r\ndefault. orjson benchmarks as being faster at serializing non-`str` keys\r\nthan other libraries. This option is slower for `str` keys than the default.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime, uuid\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        {uuid.UUID(\"7202d115-7ff3-4c81-a7c1-2a1f067b1ece\"): [1, 2, 3]},\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS,\r\n    )\r\nb'{\"7202d115-7ff3-4c81-a7c1-2a1f067b1ece\":[1,2,3]}'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        {datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0): [1, 2, 3]},\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC,\r\n    )\r\nb'{\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\":[1,2,3]}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese types are generally serialized how they would be as\r\nvalues, e.g., `datetime.datetime` is still an RFC 3339 string and respects\r\noptions affecting it. The exception is that `int` serialization does not\r\nrespect `OPT_STRICT_INTEGER`.\r\n\r\nThis option has the risk of creating duplicate keys. This is because non-`str`\r\nobjects may serialize to the same `str` as an existing key, e.g.,\r\n`{\"1\": true, 1: false}`. The last key to be inserted to the `dict` will be\r\nserialized last and a JSON deserializer will presumably take the last\r\noccurrence of a key (in the above, `false`). The first value will be lost.\r\n\r\nThis option is compatible with `orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS`. If sorting is used,\r\nnote the sort is unstable and will be unpredictable for duplicate keys.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n    {\"other\": 1, datetime.date(1970, 1, 5): 2, datetime.date(1970, 1, 3): 3},\r\n    option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS | orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS\r\n)\r\nb'{\"1970-01-03\":3,\"1970-01-05\":2,\"other\":1}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis measures serializing 589KiB of JSON comprising a `list` of 100 `dict`\r\nin which each `dict` has both 365 randomly-sorted `int` keys representing epoch\r\ntimestamps as well as one `str` key and the value for each key is a\r\nsingle integer. In \"str keys\", the keys were converted to `str` before\r\nserialization, and orjson still specifes `option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS`\r\n(which is always somewhat slower).\r\n\r\n| Library    |   str keys (ms) | int keys (ms)   | int keys sorted (ms)   |\r\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|\r\n| orjson     |            1.53 | 2.16            | 4.29                   |\r\n| ujson      |            3.07 | 5.65            |                        |\r\n| rapidjson  |            4.29 |                 |                        |\r\n| simplejson |           11.24 | 14.50           | 21.86                  |\r\n| json       |            7.17 | 8.49            |                        |\r\n\r\nujson is blank for sorting because it segfaults. json is blank because it\r\nraises `TypeError` on attempting to sort before converting all keys to `str`.\r\nrapidjson is blank because it does not support non-`str` keys. This can\r\nbe reproduced using the `pynonstr` script.\r\n\r\n##### OPT_OMIT_MICROSECONDS\r\n\r\nDo not serialize the `microsecond` field on `datetime.datetime` and\r\n`datetime.time` instances.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1),\r\n    )\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000001\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1),\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_OMIT_MICROSECONDS,\r\n    )\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATACLASS\r\n\r\nPassthrough `dataclasses.dataclass` instances to `default`. This allows\r\ncustomizing their output but is much slower.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, dataclasses\r\n>>>\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass User:\r\n    id: str\r\n    name: str\r\n    password: str\r\n\r\ndef default(obj):\r\n    if isinstance(obj, User):\r\n        return {\"id\": obj.id, \"name\": obj.name}\r\n    raise TypeError\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(User(\"3b1\", \"asd\", \"zxc\"))\r\nb'{\"id\":\"3b1\",\"name\":\"asd\",\"password\":\"zxc\"}'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(User(\"3b1\", \"asd\", \"zxc\"), option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATACLASS)\r\nTypeError: Type is not JSON serializable: User\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        User(\"3b1\", \"asd\", \"zxc\"),\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATACLASS,\r\n        default=default,\r\n    )\r\nb'{\"id\":\"3b1\",\"name\":\"asd\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME\r\n\r\nPassthrough `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.date`, and `datetime.time` instances\r\nto `default`. This allows serializing datetimes to a custom format, e.g.,\r\nHTTP dates:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime\r\n>>>\r\ndef default(obj):\r\n    if isinstance(obj, datetime.datetime):\r\n        return obj.strftime(\"%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT\")\r\n    raise TypeError\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"created_at\": datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)})\r\nb'{\"created_at\":\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"}'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"created_at\": datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)}, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME)\r\nTypeError: Type is not JSON serializable: datetime.datetime\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        {\"created_at\": datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)},\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME,\r\n        default=default,\r\n    )\r\nb'{\"created_at\":\"Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not affect datetimes in `dict` keys if using OPT_NON_STR_KEYS.\r\n\r\n##### OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS\r\n\r\nPassthrough subclasses of builtin types to `default`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>>\r\nclass Secret(str):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef default(obj):\r\n    if isinstance(obj, Secret):\r\n        return \"******\"\r\n    raise TypeError\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(Secret(\"zxc\"))\r\nb'\"zxc\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(Secret(\"zxc\"), option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)\r\nTypeError: Type is not JSON serializable: Secret\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(Secret(\"zxc\"), option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS, default=default)\r\nb'\"******\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not affect serializing subclasses as `dict` keys if using\r\nOPT_NON_STR_KEYS.\r\n\r\n##### OPT_SERIALIZE_DATACLASS\r\n\r\nThis is deprecated and has no effect in version 3. In version 2 this was\r\nrequired to serialize  `dataclasses.dataclass` instances. For more, see\r\n[dataclass](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#dataclass).\r\n\r\n##### OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY\r\n\r\nSerialize `numpy.ndarray` instances. For more, see\r\n[numpy](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#numpy).\r\n\r\n##### OPT_SERIALIZE_UUID\r\n\r\nThis is deprecated and has no effect in version 3.

For more, see\r\n[UUID](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#UUID).\r\n\r\n##### OPT_SORT_KEYS\r\n\r\nSerialize `dict` keys in sorted order. The default is to serialize in an\r\nunspecified order. This is equivalent to `sort_keys=True` in the standard\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nThis can be used to ensure the order is deterministic for hashing or tests.\r\nIt has a substantial performance penalty and is not recommended in general.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"b\": 1, \"c\": 2, \"a\": 3})\r\nb'{\"b\":1,\"c\":2,\"a\":3}'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"b\": 1, \"c\": 2, \"a\": 3}, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)\r\nb'{\"a\":3,\"b\":1,\"c\":2}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis measures serializing the twitter.json fixture unsorted and sorted:\r\n\r\n| Library    |   unsorted (ms) |   sorted (ms) |   vs. orjson |\r\n|------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|\r\n| orjson     |            0.32 |          0.54 |          1   |\r\n| ujson      |            1.6  |          2.07 |          3.8 |\r\n| rapidjson  |            1.12 |          1.65 |          3.1 |\r\n| simplejson |            2.25 |          3.13 |          5.8 |\r\n| json       |            1.78 |          2.32 |          4.3 |\r\n\r\nThe benchmark can be reproduced using the `pysort` script.\r\n\r\nThe sorting is not collation/locale-aware:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"a\": 1, \"ä\": 2, \"A\": 3}, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)\r\nb'{\"A\":3,\"a\":1,\"\\xc3\\xa4\":2}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the same sorting behavior as the standard library, rapidjson,\r\nsimplejson, and ujson.\r\n\r\n`dataclass` also serialize as maps but this has no effect on them.\r\n\r\n##### OPT_STRICT_INTEGER\r\n\r\nEnforce 53-bit limit on integers. The limit is otherwise 64 bits, the same as\r\nthe Python standard library. For more, see [int](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#int).\r\n\r\n##### OPT_UTC_Z\r\n\r\nSerialize a UTC timezone on `datetime.datetime` instances as `Z` instead\r\nof `+00:00`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime, zoneinfo\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\")),\r\n    )\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\")),\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_UTC_Z\r\n    )\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Fragment\r\n\r\n`orjson.Fragment` includes already-serialized JSON in a document. This is an\r\nefficient way to include JSON blobs from a cache, JSONB field, or separately\r\nserialized object without first deserializing to Python objects via `loads()`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>> orjson.dumps({\"key\": \"zxc\", \"data\": orjson.Fragment(b'{\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": 1}')})\r\nb'{\"key\":\"zxc\",\"data\":{\"a\": \"b\", \"c\": 1}}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does no reformatting: `orjson.OPT_INDENT_2` will not affect a\r\ncompact blob nor will a pretty-printed JSON blob be rewritten as compact.\r\n\r\nThe input must be `bytes` or `str` and given as a positional argument.\r\n\r\nThis raises `orjson.JSONEncodeError` if a `str` is given and the input is\r\nnot valid UTF-8. It otherwise does no validation and it is possible to\r\nwrite invalid JSON. This does not escape characters. The implementation is\r\ntested to not crash if given invalid strings or invalid JSON.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to `RawJSON` in rapidjson.\r\n\r\n### Deserialize\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef loads(__obj: Union[bytes, bytearray, memoryview, str]) -> Any: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`loads()` deserializes JSON to Python objects. It deserializes to `dict`,\r\n`list`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and `None` objects.\r\n\r\n`bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`, and `str` input are accepted. If the input\r\nexists as a `memoryview`, `bytearray`, or `bytes` object, it is recommended to\r\npass these directly rather than creating an unnecessary `str` object. That is,\r\n`orjson.loads(b\"{}\")` instead of `orjson.loads(b\"{}\".decode(\"utf-8\"))`. This\r\nhas lower memory usage and lower latency.\r\n\r\nThe input must be valid UTF-8.\r\n\r\norjson maintains a cache of map keys for the duration of the process. This\r\ncauses a net reduction in memory usage by avoiding duplicate strings. The\r\nkeys must be at most 64 bytes to be cached and 1024 entries are stored.\r\n\r\nThe global interpreter lock (GIL) is held for the duration of the call.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONDecodeError` if given an invalid type or invalid\r\nJSON. This includes if the input contains `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `-Infinity`,\r\nwhich the standard library allows, but is not valid JSON.\r\n\r\nIt raises `JSONDecodeError` if a combination of array or object recurses\r\n1024 levels deep.\r\n\r\n`JSONDecodeError` is a subclass of `json.JSONDecodeError` and `ValueError`.\r\nThis is for compatibility with the standard library.\r\n\r\n## Types\r\n\r\n### dataclass\r\n\r\norjson serializes instances of `dataclasses.dataclass` natively. It serializes\r\ninstances 40-50x as fast as other libraries and avoids a severe slowdown seen\r\nin other libraries compared to serializing `dict`.\r\n\r\nIt is supported to pass all variants of dataclasses, including dataclasses\r\nusing `__slots__`, frozen dataclasses, those with optional or default\r\nattributes, and subclasses. There is a performance benefit to not\r\nusing `__slots__`.\r\n\r\n| Library    | dict (ms)   | dataclass (ms)   | vs. orjson   |\r\n|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\r\n| orjson     | 1.40        | 1.60             | 1            |\r\n| ujson      |             |                  |              |\r\n| rapidjson  | 3.64        | 68.48            | 42           |\r\n| simplejson | 14.21       | 92.18            | 57           |\r\n| json       | 13.28       | 94.90            | 59           |\r\n\r\nThis measures serializing 555KiB of JSON, orjson natively and other libraries\r\nusing `default` to serialize the output of `dataclasses.asdict()`. This can be\r\nreproduced using the `pydataclass` script.\r\n\r\nDataclasses are serialized as maps, with every attribute serialized and in\r\nthe order given on class definition:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import dataclasses, orjson, typing\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass Member:\r\n    id: int\r\n    active: bool = dataclasses.field(default=False)\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass Object:\r\n    id: int\r\n    name: str\r\n    members: typing.List[Member]\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(Object(1, \"a\", [Member(1, True), Member(2)]))\r\nb'{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"a\",\"members\":[{\"id\":1,\"active\":true},{\"id\":2,\"active\":false}]}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### datetime\r\n\r\norjson serializes `datetime.datetime` objects to\r\n[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format,\r\ne.g., \"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\". This is a subset of ISO 8601 and is\r\ncompatible with `isoformat()` in the standard library.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime, zoneinfo\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n    datetime.datetime(2018, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"Australia/Adelaide\"))\r\n)\r\nb'\"2018-12-01T02:03:04.000009+10:30\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n    datetime.datetime(2100, 9, 1, 21, 55, 2).replace(tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(\"UTC\"))\r\n)\r\nb'\"2100-09-01T21:55:02+00:00\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n    datetime.datetime(2100, 9, 1, 21, 55, 2)\r\n)\r\nb'\"2100-09-01T21:55:02\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n`datetime.datetime` supports instances with a `tzinfo` that is `None`,\r\n`datetime.timezone.utc`, a timezone instance from the python3.9+ `zoneinfo`\r\nmodule, or a timezone instance from the third-party `pendulum`, `pytz`, or\r\n`dateutil`/`arrow` libraries.\r\n\r\nIt is fastest to use the standard library's `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo` for timezones.\r\n\r\n`datetime.time` objects must not have a `tzinfo`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(datetime.time(12, 0, 15, 290))\r\nb'\"12:00:15.000290\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n`datetime.date` objects will always serialize.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, datetime\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(datetime.date(1900, 1, 2))\r\nb'\"1900-01-02\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\nErrors with `tzinfo` result in `JSONEncodeError` being raised.\r\n\r\nTo disable serialization of `datetime` objects specify the option\r\n`orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_DATETIME`.\r\n\r\nTo use \"Z\" suffix instead of \"+00:00\" to indicate UTC (\"Zulu\") time, use the option\r\n`orjson.OPT_UTC_Z`.\r\n\r\nTo assume datetimes without timezone are UTC, use the option `orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC`.\r\n\r\n### enum\r\n\r\norjson serializes enums natively. Options apply to their values.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import enum, datetime, orjson\r\n>>>\r\nclass DatetimeEnum(enum.Enum):\r\n    EPOCH = datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(DatetimeEnum.EPOCH)\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(DatetimeEnum.EPOCH, option=orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC)\r\nb'\"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnums with members that are not supported types can be serialized using\r\n`default`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import enum, orjson\r\n>>>\r\nclass Custom:\r\n    def __init__(self, val):\r\n        self.val = val\r\n\r\ndef default(obj):\r\n    if isinstance(obj, Custom):\r\n        return obj.val\r\n    raise TypeError\r\n\r\nclass CustomEnum(enum.Enum):\r\n    ONE = Custom(1)\r\n\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(CustomEnum.ONE, default=default)\r\nb'1'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### float\r\n\r\norjson serializes and deserializes double precision floats with no loss of\r\nprecision and consistent rounding.\r\n\r\n`orjson.dumps()` serializes Nan, Infinity, and -Infinity, which are not\r\ncompliant JSON, as `null`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, ujson, rapidjson, json\r\n>>> orjson.dumps([float(\"NaN\"), float(\"Infinity\"), float(\"-Infinity\")])\r\nb'[null,null,null]'\r\n>>> ujson.dumps([float(\"NaN\"), float(\"Infinity\"), float(\"-Infinity\")])\r\nOverflowError: Invalid Inf value when encoding double\r\n>>> rapidjson.dumps([float(\"NaN\"), float(\"Infinity\"), float(\"-Infinity\")])\r\n'[NaN,Infinity,-Infinity]'\r\n>>> json.dumps([float(\"NaN\"), float(\"Infinity\"), float(\"-Infinity\")])\r\n'[NaN, Infinity, -Infinity]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### int\r\n\r\norjson serializes and deserializes 64-bit integers by default.

This\r\nis widely compatible, but there are implementations\r\nthat only support 53-bits for integers, e.g.,\r\nweb browsers. For those implementations, `dumps()` can be configured to\r\nraise a `JSONEncodeError` on values exceeding the 53-bit range.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(9007199254740992)\r\nb'9007199254740992'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(9007199254740992, option=orjson.OPT_STRICT_INTEGER)\r\nJSONEncodeError: Integer exceeds 53-bit range\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(-9007199254740992, option=orjson.OPT_STRICT_INTEGER)\r\nJSONEncodeError: Integer exceeds 53-bit range\r\n```\r\n\r\n### numpy\r\n\r\norjson natively serializes `numpy.ndarray` and individual\r\n`numpy.float64`, `numpy.float32`, `numpy.float16` (`numpy.half`),\r\n`numpy.int64`, `numpy.int32`, `numpy.int16`, `numpy.int8`,\r\n`numpy.uint64`, `numpy.uint32`, `numpy.uint16`, `numpy.uint8`,\r\n`numpy.uintp`, `numpy.intp`, `numpy.datetime64`, and `numpy.bool`\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\norjson is faster than all compared libraries at serializing\r\nnumpy instances.

This\r\ncan result in different rounding.\r\n\r\n`numpy.datetime64` instances are serialized as RFC 3339 strings and\r\ndatetime options affect them.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import orjson, numpy\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        numpy.datetime64(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.172\"),\r\n        option=orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY,\r\n)\r\nb'\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.172000\"'\r\n>>> orjson.dumps(\r\n        numpy.datetime64(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.172\"),\r\n        option=(\r\n            orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY |\r\n            orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC |\r\n            orjson.OPT_OMIT_MICROSECONDS\r\n        ),\r\n)\r\nb'\"2021-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf an array is not a contiguous C array, contains an unsupported datatype,\r\nor contains a `numpy.datetime64` using an unsupported representation\r\n(e.g., picoseconds), orjson falls through to `default`.

It is tested to not crash against the\r\n[Big List of Naughty Strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings).\r\nIt is tested to not leak memory. It is tested to not crash\r\nagainst and not accept invalid UTF-8. There are integration tests\r\nexercising the library's use in web servers (gunicorn using multiprocess/forked\r\nworkers) and when\r\nmultithreaded. It also uses some tests from the ultrajson library.\r\n\r\norjson is the most correct of the compared libraries. This graph shows how each\r\nlibrary handles a combined 342 JSON fixtures from the\r\n[JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite) and\r\n[nativejson-benchmark](https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark) tests:\r\n\r\n| Library    |   Invalid JSON documents not rejected |   Valid JSON documents not deserialized |\r\n|------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\r\n| orjson     |                                     0 |                                       0 |\r\n| ujson      |                                    31 |                                       0 |\r\n| rapidjson  |                                     6 |                                       0 |\r\n| simplejson |                                    10 |                                       0 |\r\n| json       |                                    17 |                                       0 |\r\n\r\nThis shows that all libraries deserialize valid JSON but only orjson\r\ncorrectly rejects the given invalid JSON fixtures. Errors are largely due to\r\naccepting invalid strings and numbers.\r\n\r\nThe graph above can be reproduced using the `pycorrectness` script.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nSerialization and deserialization performance of orjson is better than\r\nultrajson, rapidjson, simplejson, or json. The benchmarks are done on\r\nfixtures of real data:\r\n\r\n* twitter.json, 631.5KiB, results of a search on Twitter for \"一\", containing\r\nCJK strings, dictionaries of strings and arrays of dictionaries, indented.\r\n\r\n* github.json, 55.8KiB, a GitHub activity feed, containing dictionaries of\r\nstrings and arrays of dictionaries, not indented.\r\n\r\n* citm_catalog.json, 1.7MiB, concert data, containing nested dictionaries of\r\nstrings and arrays of integers, indented.\r\n\r\n* canada.json, 2.2MiB, coordinates of the Canadian border in GeoJSON\r\nformat, containing floats and arrays, indented.\r\n\r\n### Latency\r\n\r\n![Serialization](doc/serialization.png)\r\n\r\n![Deserialization](doc/deserialization.png)\r\n\r\n#### twitter.json serialization\r\n\r\n| Library    |

The memory results can be reproduced using the `pymem` script.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n### Why can't I install it from PyPI?\r\n\r\nProbably `pip` needs to be upgraded to version 20.3 or later to support\r\nthe latest manylinux_x_y or universal2 wheel formats.\r\n\r\n### \"Cargo, the Rust package manager, is not installed or is not on PATH.\"\r\n\r\nThis happens when there are no binary wheels (like manylinux) for your\r\nplatform on PyPI. You can install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) through\r\n`rustup` or a package manager and then it will compile.\r\n\r\n### Will it deserialize to dataclasses, UUIDs, decimals, etc or support object_hook?\r\n\r\nNo. This requires a schema specifying what types are expected and how to\r\nhandle errors etc. This is addressed by data validation libraries a\r\nlevel above this.\r\n\r\n### Will it serialize to `str`?\r\n\r\nNo. `bytes` is the correct type for a serialized blob.\r\n\r\n## Packaging\r\n\r\nTo package orjson requires at least [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.72\r\nand the [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) build tool. The recommended\r\nbuild command is:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmaturin build --release --strip\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt benefits from also having a C build environment to compile a faster\r\ndeserialization backend. See this project's `manylinux_2_28` builds for an\r\nexample using clang and LTO.\r\n\r\nThe project's own CI tests against `nightly-2024-04-15` and stable 1.72. It\r\nis prudent to pin the nightly version because that channel can introduce\r\nbreaking changes.\r\n\r\norjson is tested for amd64, aarch64, arm7, ppc64le, and s390x on Linux. It\r\nis tested for either aarch64 or amd64 on macOS and cross-compiles for the other,\r\ndepending on version. For Windows it is tested on amd64 and i686.\r\n\r\nThere are no runtime dependencies other than libc.\r\n\r\nThe source distribution on PyPI contains all dependencies' source and can be\r\nbuilt without network access.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)\n- [python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\n- [pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations](https://github.com/stub42/pytz)\n\nSee the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.\n\n## Installation from sources\nTo install pandas from source you need [Cython](https://cython.org/) in addition to the normal\ndependencies above. Cython can be installed from PyPI:\n\n```sh\npip install cython\n```\n\nIn the `pandas` directory (same one where you found this file after\ncloning the git repo), execute:\n\n```sh\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nor for installing in [development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#install-editable):\n\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-use-pep517\n```\n\nIf you have `make`, you can also use `make develop` to run the same command.\n\nor alternatively\n\n```sh\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\nSee the full instructions for [installing from source](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#installing-from-source).\n\n## License\n[BSD 3](LICENSE)\n\n## Documentation\nThe official documentation is hosted on PyData.org: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable\n\n## Background\nWork on ``pandas`` started at [AQR](https://www.aqr.com/) (a quantitative hedge fund) in 2008 and\nhas been under active development since then.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nFor usage questions, the best place to go to is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas).\nFurther, general questions and discussions can also take place on the [pydata mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydata).\n\n## Discussion and Development\nMost development discussions take place on GitHub in this repo.

Take a look at\n`tests/integration/hello_world/hello_world_client.py` for the complete example.\n\n```python\nimport grpc\nfrom concurrent import futures\nfrom py_grpc_prometheus.prometheus_server_interceptor import PromServerInterceptor\nfrom prometheus_client import start_http_server\n```\n\nStart the gRPC server with the interceptor, take a look at\n`tests/integration/hello_world/hello_world_server.py` for the complete example.\n\n```python\nserver = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10),\n                         interceptors=(PromServerInterceptor(),))\n# Start an end point to expose metrics.\nstart_http_server(metrics_port)\n```\n\n## Histograms\n\n[Prometheus histograms](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) are a great way\nto measure latency distributions of your RPCs. However, since it is bad practice to have metrics\nof [high cardinality](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/#do-not-overuse-labels)\nthe latency monitoring metrics are disabled by default. To enable them please call the following\nin your interceptor initialization code:\n\n```jsoniq\nserver = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10),\n                     interceptors=(PromServerInterceptor(enable_handling_time_histogram=True),))\n```\n\nAfter the call completes, its handling time will be recorded in a [Prometheus histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)\nvariable `grpc_server_handling_seconds`. The histogram variable contains three sub-metrics:\n\n * `grpc_server_handling_seconds_count` - the count of all completed RPCs by status and method\n * `grpc_server_handling_seconds_sum` - cumulative time of RPCs by status and method, useful for\n   calculating average handling times\n * `grpc_server_handling_seconds_bucket` - contains the counts of RPCs by status and method in respective\n   handling-time buckets. These buckets can be used by Prometheus to estimate SLAs (see [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/))\n\n## Server Side:\n- enable_handling_time_histogram: Enables 'grpc_server_handling_seconds'\n\n## Client Side:\n- enable_client_handling_time_histogram: Enables 'grpc_client_handling_seconds'\n- enable_client_stream_receive_time_histogram: Enables 'grpc_client_msg_recv_handling_seconds'\n- enable_client_stream_send_time_histogram: Enables 'grpc_client_msg_send_handling_seconds'\n\n## Legacy metrics:\n\nMetric names have been updated to be in line with those from https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus.\n\nThe legacy metrics are:\n\n### server side:\n- grpc_server_started_total\n- grpc_server_handled_total\n- grpc_server_handled_latency_seconds\n- grpc_server_msg_received_total\n- grpc_server_msg_sent_total\n\n### client side:\n- grpc_client_started_total\n- grpc_client_completed\n- grpc_client_completed_latency_seconds\n- grpc_client_msg_sent_total\n- grpc_client_msg_received_total\n\nIn order to be able to use these legacy metrics for backwards compatibility, the `legacy` flag can be set to `True` when initialising the server/client interceptors\n\nFor example, to enable the server side legacy metrics:\n```jsoniq\nserver = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10),\n                     interceptors=(PromServerInterceptor(legacy=True),))\n```\n\n## How to run and test\n```sh\nmake initialize-development\nmake test\n```\n\n## TODO:\n- Unit test with https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/blob/master/tests/unit/trace/ext/grpc/test_server_interceptor.py\n\n## Reference\n- https://grpc.io/grpc/python/grpc.html\n- https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/blob/master/opencensus/trace/ext/grpc/utils.py\n- https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/python-grpc/blob/b4bdc7ce81fa75ede00f7c6bcf5dab8fae47332a/grpc_opentracing/grpcext/grpc_interceptor/server_interceptor.py\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/33/d8/038f4774d761380663c6755dcd01ae983d93944bd4916af27bd009a2aadc/py_grpc_prometheus-0.8.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

It helps in the development of applications following the\n[12-factor](https://12factor.net/) principles.\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Other Use Cases](#other-use-cases)\n  * [Load configuration without altering the environment](#load-configuration-without-altering-the-environment)\n  * [Parse configuration as a stream](#parse-configuration-as-a-stream)\n  * [Load .env files in IPython](#load-env-files-in-ipython)\n- [Command-line Interface](#command-line-interface)\n- [File format](#file-format)\n  * [Multiline values](#multiline-values)\n  * [Variable expansion](#variable-expansion)\n- [Related Projects](#related-projects)\n- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```shell\npip install python-dotenv\n```\n\nIf your application takes its configuration from environment variables, like a 12-factor\napplication, launching it in development is not very practical because you have to set\nthose environment variables yourself.\n\nTo help you with that, you can add Python-dotenv to your application to make it load the\nconfiguration from a `.env` file when it is present (e.g. in development) while remaining\nconfigurable via the environment:\n\n```python\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()  # take environment variables from .env.\n\n# Code of your application, which uses environment variables (e.g. from `os.environ` or\n# `os.getenv`) as if they came from the actual environment.\n```\n\nBy default, `load_dotenv` doesn't override existing environment variables.\n\nTo configure the development environment, add a `.env` in the root directory of your\nproject:\n\n```\n.\n├── .env\n└── foo.py\n```\n\nThe syntax of `.env` files supported by python-dotenv is similar to that of Bash:\n\n```bash\n# Development settings\nDOMAIN=example.org\nADMIN_EMAIL=admin@${DOMAIN}\nROOT_URL=${DOMAIN}/app\n```\n\nIf you use variables in values, ensure they are surrounded with `{` and `}`, like\n`${DOMAIN}`, as bare variables such as `$DOMAIN` are not expanded.\n\nYou will probably want to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`, especially if it contains\nsecrets like a password.\n\nSee the section \"File format\" below for more information about what you can write in a\n`.env` file.\n\n## Other Use Cases\n\n### Load configuration without altering the environment\n\nThe function `dotenv_values` works more or less the same way as `load_dotenv`, except it\ndoesn't touch the environment, it just returns a `dict` with the values parsed from the\n`.env` file.\n\n```python\nfrom dotenv import dotenv_values\n\nconfig = dotenv_values(\".env\")  # config = {\"USER\": \"foo\", \"EMAIL\": \"foo@example.org\"}\n```\n\nThis notably enables advanced configuration management:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import dotenv_values\n\nconfig = {\n    **dotenv_values(\".env.shared\"),  # load shared development variables\n    **dotenv_values(\".env.secret\"),  # load sensitive variables\n    **os.environ,  # override loaded values with environment variables\n}\n```\n\n### Parse configuration as a stream\n\n`load_dotenv` and `dotenv_values` accept [streams][python_streams] via their `stream`\nargument.  It is thus possible to load the variables from sources other than the\nfilesystem (e.g. the network).\n\n```python\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nconfig = StringIO(\"USER=foo\\nEMAIL=foo@example.org\")\nload_dotenv(stream=config)\n```\n\n### Load .env files in IPython\n\nYou can use dotenv in IPython.  By default, it will use `find_dotenv` to search for a\n`.env` file:\n\n```python\n%load_ext dotenv\n%dotenv\n```\n\nYou can also specify a path:\n\n```python\n%dotenv relative/or/absolute/path/to/.env\n```\n\nOptional flags:\n\n- `-o` to override existing variables.\n- `-v` for increased verbosity.\n\n## Command-line Interface\n\nA CLI interface `dotenv` is also included, which helps you manipulate the `.env` file\nwithout manually opening it.\n\n```shell\n$ pip install \"python-dotenv[cli]\"\n$ dotenv set USER foo\n$ dotenv set EMAIL foo@example.org\n$ dotenv list\nUSER=foo\nEMAIL=foo@example.org\n$ dotenv list --format=json\n{\n  \"USER\": \"foo\",\n  \"EMAIL\": \"foo@example.org\"\n}\n$ dotenv run -- python foo.py\n```\n\nRun `dotenv --help` for more information about the options and subcommands.\n\n## File format\n\nThe format is not formally specified and still improves over time.  That being said,\n`.env` files should mostly look like Bash files.\n\nKeys can be unquoted or single-quoted. Values can be unquoted, single- or double-quoted.\nSpaces before and after keys, equal signs, and values are ignored. Values can be followed\nby a comment.  Lines can start with the `export` directive, which does not affect their\ninterpretation.\n\nAllowed escape sequences:\n\n- in single-quoted values: `\\\\`, `\\'`\n- in double-quoted values: `\\\\`, `\\'`, `\\\"`, `\\a`, `\\b`, `\\f`, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\t`, `\\v`\n\n### Multiline values\n\nIt is possible for single- or double-quoted values to span multiple lines.  The following\nexamples are equivalent:\n\n```bash\nFOO=\"first line\nsecond line\"\n```\n\n```bash\nFOO=\"first line\\nsecond line\"\n```\n\n### Variable without a value\n\nA variable can have no value:\n\n```bash\nFOO\n```\n\nIt results in `dotenv_values` associating that variable name with the value `None` (e.g.\n`{\"FOO\": None}`. `load_dotenv`, on the other hand, simply ignores such variables.\n\nThis shouldn't be confused with `FOO=`, in which case the variable is associated with the\nempty string.\n\n### Variable expansion\n\nPython-dotenv can interpolate variables using POSIX variable expansion.\n\nWith `load_dotenv(override=True)` or `dotenv_values()`, the value of a variable is the\nfirst of the values defined in the following list:\n\n- Value of that variable in the `.env` file.\n- Value of that variable in the environment.\n- Default value, if provided.\n- Empty string.\n\nWith `load_dotenv(override=False)`, the value of a variable is the first of the values\ndefined in the following list:\n\n- Value of that variable in the environment.\n- Value of that variable in the `.env` file.\n- Default value, if provided.\n- Empty string.\n\n## Related Projects\n\n-   [Honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho) - For managing\n    Procfile-based applications.\n-   [django-dotenv](https://github.com/jpadilla/django-dotenv)\n-   [django-environ](https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ)\n-   [django-environ-2](https://github.com/sergeyklay/django-environ-2)\n-   [django-configuration](https://github.com/jezdez/django-configurations)\n-   [dump-env](https://github.com/sobolevn/dump-env)\n-   [environs](https://github.com/sloria/environs)\n-   [dynaconf](https://github.com/rochacbruno/dynaconf)\n-   [parse_it](https://github.com/naorlivne/parse_it)\n-   [python-decouple](https://github.com/HBNetwork/python-decouple)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is currently maintained by [Saurabh Kumar](https://saurabh-kumar.com) and\n[Bertrand Bonnefoy-Claudet](https://github.com/bbc2) and would not have been possible\nwithout the support of these [awesome\npeople](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv/graphs/contributors).\n\n[build_status_badge]: https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg\n[build_status_link]: https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv/actions/workflows/test.yml\n[pypi_badge]: https://badge.fury.io/py/python-dotenv.svg\n[pypi_link]: https://badge.fury.io/py/python-dotenv\n[python_streams]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html\n\n# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this\nproject adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [1.0.1] - 2024-01-23\n\n**Fixed**\n\n* Gracefully handle code which has been imported from a zipfile ([#456] by [@samwyma])\n* Allow modules using load_dotenv to be reloaded when launched in a separate thread ([#497] by [@freddyaboulton])\n* Fix file not closed after deletion, handle error in the rewrite function ([#469] by [@Qwerty-133])\n\n**Misc**\n* Use pathlib.Path in tests ([#466] by [@eumiro])\n* Fix year in release date in changelog.md ([#454] by [@jankislinger])\n* Use https in README links ([#474] by [@Nicals])\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2023-02-24\n\n**Fixed**\n\n* Drop support for python 3.7, add python 3.12-dev (#449 by [@theskumar])\n* Handle situations where the cwd does not exist.

The values can be either a static value or a callback function that\nretrieves a value from the `Request` object. [See below](#labels) for examples.\n\n`exemplars`: Optional dict containing label/value pairs. The \"value\" should be a callback function that returns the desired value at runtime.\n\n`group_paths`: Populate the path label using named parameters (if any) in the router path, e.g. `/api/v1/items/{item_id}`. This will group requests together by endpoint (regardless of the value of `item_id`). As of v0.18.0, the default is `True`, and changing to `False` is highly discouraged (see [warnings about cardinality](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/02/15/what-are-cardinality-spikes-and-why-do-they-matter/)).\n\n`filter_unhandled_paths`: setting this to `True` will cause the middleware to ignore requests with unhandled paths (in other words, 404 errors). This helps prevent filling up the metrics with 404 errors and/or intentially bad requests. Default is `True`.\n\n`buckets`: accepts an optional list of numbers to use as histogram buckets. The default value is `None`, which will cause the library to fall back on the Prometheus defaults (currently `[0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0]`).\n\n`skip_paths`: accepts an optional list of paths, or regular expressions for paths, that will not collect metrics. The default value is `None`, which will cause the library to collect metrics on every requested path. This option is useful to avoid collecting metrics on health check, readiness or liveness probe endpoints.\n\n`skip_methods`: accepts an optional list of methods that will not collect metrics. The default value is `None`, which will cause the library to collect request metrics with each method. This option is useful to avoid collecting metrics on requests related to the communication description for endpoints.\n\n`always_use_int_status`: accepts a boolean. The default value is False. If set to True the libary will attempt to convert the `status_code` value to an integer (e.g. if you are using HTTPStatus, HTTPStatus.OK will become 200 for all metrics).\n\n`optional_metrics`: a list of pre-defined metrics that can be optionally added to the default metrics. The following optional metrics are available:\n\n* `response_body_size`: a counter that tracks the size of response bodies for each endpoint\n\nFor optional metric examples, [see below](#optional-metrics).\n\nFull example:\n\n```python\napp.add_middleware(\n  PrometheusMiddleware,\n  app_name=\"hello_world\",\n  prefix='myapp',\n  labels={\n      \"server_name\": os.getenv(\"HOSTNAME\"),\n  }),\n  buckets=[0.1, 0.25, 0.5],\n  skip_paths=['/health'],\n  skip_methods=['OPTIONS'],\n  always_use_int_status=False),\n  exemplars=lambda: {\"trace_id\": get_trace_id}  # function that returns a trace id\n```\n\n## Labels\n\nThe included metrics have built-in default labels such as `app_name`, `method`, `path`, and `status_code`. Additional default labels can be\nadded by passing a dictionary to the `labels` arg to `PrometheusMiddleware`. Each label's value can be either a static\nvalue or, optionally, a callback function. The built-in default label names are reserved and cannot be reused.\n\nIf a callback function is used, it will receive the Request instance as its argument.\n\n```python\napp.add_middleware(\n  PrometheusMiddleware,\n  labels={\n     \"service\": \"api\",\n     \"env\": os.getenv(\"ENV\")\n    }\n```\n\nEnsure that label names follow [Prometheus naming conventions](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) and that label\nvalues are constrained (see [this writeup from Grafana on cardinality](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/02/15/what-are-cardinality-spikes-and-why-do-they-matter/)).\n\n### Label helpers\n\n**`from_header(key: string, allowed_values: Optional[Iterable])`**: a convenience function for using a header value as a label.\n\n`allowed_values` allows you to supply a list of allowed values. If supplied, header values not in the list will result in\nan empty string being returned. This allows you to constrain the label values, reducing the risk of excessive cardinality.\n\nDo not use headers that could contain unconstrained values (e.g. user id) or user-supplied values.\n\n```python\nfrom starlette_exporter import PrometheusMiddleware, from_header\n\napp.add_middleware(\n  PrometheusMiddleware,\n  labels={\n      \"host\": from_header(\"X-Internal-Org\", allowed_values=(\"accounting\", \"marketing\", \"product\"))\n    }\n```\n\n## Exemplars\n\nExemplars are used for labeling histogram observations or counter increments with a trace id. This allows adding\ntrace ids to your charts (for example, latency graphs could include traces corresponding to various latency buckets).\n\nTo add exemplars to `starlette_exporter` metrics, pass a dict to the PrometheusMiddleware class with label as well as\na callback function that returns a string (typically the current trace id).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# must use `handle_openmetrics` instead of `handle_metrics` for exemplars to appear in /metrics output.\nfrom starlette_exporter import PrometheusMiddleware, handle_openmetrics\n\napp.add_middleware(\n  PrometheusMiddleware,\n  exemplars=lambda: {\"trace_id\": get_trace_id}  # supply your own callback function\n)\n\napp.add_route(\"/metrics\", handle_openmetrics)\n```\n\nExemplars are only supported by the openmetrics-text exposition format. A new `handle_openmetrics` handler function is provided\n(see above example).\n\nFor more information, see the [Grafana exemplar documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/fundamentals/exemplars/).\n\n## Optional metrics\n\nOptional metrics are pre-defined metrics that can be added to the default metrics.\n\n* `response_body_size`: the size of response bodies returned, in bytes\n* `request_body_size`: the size of request bodies received, in bytes\n\n**Example**:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom starlette_exporter import PrometheusMiddleware, handle_metrics\nfrom starlette_exporter.optional_metrics import response_body_size, request_body_size\n\napp = FastAPI()\napp.add_middleware(PrometheusMiddleware, optional_metrics=[response_body_size, request_body_size])\n```\n\n## Custom Metrics\n\nstarlette_exporter will export all the prometheus metrics from the process, so custom metrics can be created by using the prometheus_client API.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Counter\nfrom starlette.responses import RedirectResponse\n\nREDIRECT_COUNT = Counter(\"redirect_total\", \"Count of redirects\", [\"redirected_from\"])\n\nasync def some_view(request):\n    REDIRECT_COUNT.labels(\"some_view\").inc()\n    return RedirectResponse(url=\"https://example.com\", status_code=302)\n```\n\nThe new metric will now be included in the the `/metrics` endpoint output:\n\n```\n...\nredirect_total{redirected_from=\"some_view\"} 2.0\n...\n```\n\n## Multiprocess mode (gunicorn deployments)\n\nRunning starlette_exporter in a multiprocess deployment (e.g. with gunicorn) will need the `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` env variable set, as well as extra gunicorn config.\n\nFor more information, see the [Prometheus Python client documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python#multiprocess-mode-eg-gunicorn).\n\n## Developing\n\nThis package supports Python 3.6+.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/stephenhillier/starlette_exporter\ncd starlette_exporter\npytest tests\n```\n\n## License\n\nCode released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](./LICENSE).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nhttps://github.com/prometheus/client_python (>= 0.12)\n\nhttps://github.com/encode/starlette\n\n## Credits\n\nStarlette - https://github.com/encode/starlette\n\nFastAPI - https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi\n\nFlask exporter - https://github.com/rycus86/prometheus_flask_exporter\n\nAlternate Starlette exporter - https://github.com/perdy/starlette-prometheus\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d5/bf/0ebd7b25557cc00433c87f3acbcd36db897d56f98407cbc584982c274197/starlette_exporter-0.21.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

The [ASGI specification][asgi] fills this gap, and means we're now able to\nstart building a common set of tooling usable across all async frameworks.\n\nUvicorn supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall using `pip`:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install uvicorn\n```\n\nThis will install uvicorn with minimal (pure Python) dependencies.\n\n```shell\n$ pip install 'uvicorn[standard]'\n```\n\nThis will install uvicorn with \"Cython-based\" dependencies (where possible) and other \"optional extras\".\n\nIn this context, \"Cython-based\" means the following:\n\n- the event loop `uvloop` will be installed and used if possible.\n- the http protocol will be handled by `httptools` if possible.\n\nMoreover, \"optional extras\" means that:\n\n- the websocket protocol will be handled by `websockets` (should you want to use `wsproto` you'd need to install it manually) if possible.\n- the `--reload` flag in development mode will use `watchfiles`.\n- windows users will have `colorama` installed for the colored logs.\n- `python-dotenv` will be installed should you want to use the `--env-file` option.\n- `PyYAML` will be installed to allow you to provide a `.yaml` file to `--log-config`, if desired.\n\nCreate an application, in `example.py`:\n\n```python\nasync def app(scope, receive, send):\n    assert scope['type'] == 'http'\n\n    await send({\n        'type': 'http.response.start',\n        'status': 200,\n        'headers': [\n            (b'content-type', b'text/plain'),\n        ],\n    })\n    await send({\n        'type': 'http.response.body',\n        'body': b'Hello, world!',\n    })\n```\n\nRun the server:\n\n```shell\n$ uvicorn example:app\n```\n\n---\n\n## Why ASGI?\n\nMost well established Python Web frameworks started out as WSGI-based frameworks.\n\nWSGI applications are a single, synchronous callable that takes a request and returns a response.\nThis doesn’t allow for long-lived connections, like you get with long-poll HTTP or WebSocket connections,\nwhich WSGI doesn't support well.\n\nHaving an async concurrency model also allows for options such as lightweight background tasks,\nand can be less of a limiting factor for endpoints that have long periods being blocked on network\nI/O such as dealing with slow HTTP requests.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative ASGI servers\n\nA strength of the ASGI protocol is that it decouples the server implementation\nfrom the application framework. This allows for an ecosystem of interoperating\nwebservers and application frameworks.\n\n### Daphne\n\nThe first ASGI server implementation, originally developed to power Django Channels, is [the Daphne webserver][daphne].\n\nIt is run widely in production, and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.\n\nAny of the example applications given here can equally well be run using `daphne` instead.\n\n```\n$ pip install daphne\n$ daphne app:App\n```\n\n### Hypercorn\n\n[Hypercorn][hypercorn] was initially part of the Quart web framework, before\nbeing separated out into a standalone ASGI server.\n\nHypercorn supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.\n\nIt also supports [the excellent `trio` async framework][trio], as an alternative to `asyncio`.\n\n```\n$ pip install hypercorn\n$ hypercorn app:App\n```\n\n### Mangum\n\n[Mangum][mangum] is an adapter for using ASGI applications with AWS Lambda & API Gateway.\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\"><i>Uvicorn is <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">BSD licensed</a> code.<br/>Designed & crafted with care.</i><br/>&mdash; 🦄  &mdash;</p>\n\n[asgi]: https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[daphne]: https://github.com/django/daphne\n[hypercorn]: https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn\n[mangum]: https://mangum.io\n[trio]: https://trio.readthedocs.io\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/09/d8/8aa69c76585035ca81851d99c3b00fd6be050aefd478a5376ff9fc5feb69/uvicorn-0.27.1.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright © 2017-present, [Encode OSS Ltd](https://www.encode.io/).\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

Read more about uvloop in a\n`blog post <http://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/>`_\nabout it.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nuvloop requires Python 3.8 or greater and is available on PyPI.\nUse pip to install it::\n\n    $ pip install uvloop\n\nNote that it is highly recommended to **upgrade pip before** installing\nuvloop with::\n\n    $ pip install -U pip\n\n\nUsing uvloop\n------------\n\nAs of uvloop 0.18, the preferred way of using it is via the\n``uvloop.run()`` helper function:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import uvloop\n\n    async def main():\n        # Main entry-point.\n        ...\n\n    uvloop.run(main())\n\n``uvloop.run()`` works by simply configuring ``asyncio.run()``\nto use uvloop, passing all of the arguments to it, such as ``debug``,\ne.g. ``uvloop.run(main(), debug=True)``.\n\nWith Python 3.11 and earlier the following alternative\nsnippet can be used:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import asyncio\n    import sys\n\n    import uvloop\n\n    async def main():\n        # Main entry-point.\n        ...\n\n    if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):\n        with asyncio.Runner(loop_factory=uvloop.new_event_loop) as runner:\n            runner.run(main())\n    else:\n        uvloop.install()\n        asyncio.run(main())\n\n\nBuilding From Source\n--------------------\n\nTo build uvloop, you'll need Python 3.8 or greater:\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n   .. code::\n\n    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:MagicStack/uvloop.git\n    $ cd uvloop\n\n2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:\n\n   .. code::\n\n    $ python3.7 -m venv uvloop-dev\n    $ source uvloop-dev/bin/activate\n\n3. Install development dependencies:\n\n   ..  code::\n\n    $ pip install -e .[dev]\n\n4. Build and run tests:\n\n   .. code::\n\n    $ make\n    $ make test\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nuvloop is dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses.\n","downloadUrl":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9c/16/728cc5dde368e6eddb299c5aec4d10eaf25335a5af04e8c0abd68e2e9d32/uvloop-0.19.0.tar.gz","hash":null,"isGolang":null,"licenses":[{"attribution":"Copyright (C) 2016-present the uvloop authors and contributors.\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a.

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an \"as-is\" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n      c. \"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.\n      d. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n      e. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.\n      f. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n      g. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n      h. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n      i. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n      j. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n      k. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n   2. Fair Dealing Rights.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n      b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n      c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\nAlthough not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1.

The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n   b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n      1.

You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n      3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2.

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n      a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   \n   NO WARRANTY 9.\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","GPL-2.0-only":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n< one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. >\nCopyright (C) < yyyy > < name of author >\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.

You need not follow the terms of the GNU General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material that constitutes the Autoconf program.\nCertain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of Autoconf. We call these the \"data\" portions. The rest of the Autoconf source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these comments and executable code the \"non-data\" portions.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.","GPL-3.0-or-later":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.","GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception":"﻿insert GPL v3 text here GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\nVersion 3.1, 31 March 2009\nGeneral information: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.","ISC":"ISC License\nCopyright (c) 2004-2010 by Internet Systems Consortium, Inc.

It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written\nby James Random Hacker.\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\nTy Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!","LGPL-2.1-or-later":"GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n   \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n   However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.

Distribution Obligations.\n      3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n      3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.\n      3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n         (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n         (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n      3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.\n      3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Application of this License.\n   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n   6. Versions of the License.\n      6.1. New Versions. License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to opensource.org for certification.\n      6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n      6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in association with the required Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n      6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License\n      This license is a union of the following two parts that should be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of preeminence:\n         [1] A Developer specific license.\n         [2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general licensing policy of the software.\n      In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered part.\n   7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n   8. TERMINATION.\n      8.1 Termination upon Breach\n      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n      8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n   The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n   11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n   his section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.\n   12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors.
