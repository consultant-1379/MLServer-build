      Description: '<img alt="ContourPy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contourpy/contourpy/main/docs/_static/contourpy_logo_horiz.svg"
        height="90">ContourPy is a Python library for calculating contours of 2D quadrilateral
        grids.  It is written in C++11 and wrapped using pybind11.It contains the
        2005 and 2014 algorithms used in Matplotlib as well as a newer algorithm that
        includes more features and is available in both serial and multithreaded versions.  It
        provides an easy way for Python libraries to use contouring algorithms without
        having to include Matplotlib as a dependency.  * **Documentation**: https://contourpy.readthedocs.io  *

      Description: "|CI Build Status| |Coverage Status| |PyPI| |Gitter Chat|What is
        this?~~~~~~~~~~~~~| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written
        in Python. The  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and
        OpenType  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX.
        It  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some  Mac-specific
        formats. The project has an `MIT open-source  licence <LICENSE>`__.| Among
        other things this means you can use it free of charge.`User documentation
        <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and`developer documentation
        <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html>`_are available
        at `Read the Docs <https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/>`_.Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~FontTools
        requires `Python <http://www.python.org/download/>`__ 3.8or later. We try
        to follow the same schedule of minimum Python version support asNumPy (see
        `NEP 29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`__).The
        package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you caninstall it
        with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__:.. code:: sh    pip install fonttoolsIf
        you would like to contribute to its development, you can clone therepository
        from GitHub, install the package in 'editable' mode andmodify the source code
        in place. We recommend creating a virtualenvironment, using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__
        orPython 3 `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__ module...
        code:: sh    # download the source code to 'fonttools' folder    git clone
        https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools.git    cd fonttools    # create new
        virtual environment called e.g. 'fonttools-venv', or anything you like    python
        -m virtualenv fonttools-venv    # source the `activate` shell script to enter
        the environment (Unix-like); to exit, just type `deactivate`    . fonttools-venv/bin/activate
        \   # to activate the virtual environment in Windows `cmd.exe`, do    fonttools-venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
        \   # install in 'editable' mode    pip install -e .Optional Requirements---------------------The
        ``fontTools`` package currently has no (required) external dependenciesbesides
        the modules included in the Python Standard Library.However, a few extra dependencies
        are required by some of its modules, whichare needed to unlock optional features.The
        ``fonttools`` PyPI distribution also supports so-called \"extras\", i.e. aset
        of keywords that describe a group of additional dependencies, which can beused
        when installing via pip, or when specifying a requirement.For example:.. code::
        sh    pip install fonttools[ufo,lxml,woff,unicode]This command will install
        fonttools, as well as the optional dependencies thatare required to unlock
        the extra features named \"ufo\", etc.- ``Lib/fontTools/misc/etree.py``  The
        module exports a ElementTree-like API for reading/writing XML files, and  allows
        to use as the backend either the built-in ``xml.etree`` module or  `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__.
        The latter is preferred whenever present,  as it is generally faster and more
        secure.  *Extra:* ``lxml``- ``Lib/fontTools/ufoLib``  Package for reading
        and writing UFO source files; it requires:  * `fs <https://pypi.org/pypi/fs>`__:
        (aka ``pyfilesystem2``) filesystem    abstraction layer.  * `enum34 <https://pypi.org/pypi/enum34>`__:
        backport for the built-in ``enum``    module (only required on Python < 3.4).
        \ *Extra:* ``ufo``- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/woff2.py``  Module to compress/decompress
        WOFF 2.0 web fonts; it requires:  * `brotli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brotli>`__:
        Python bindings of    the Brotli compression library.  *Extra:* ``woff``-
        ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/sfnt.py``  To better compress WOFF 1.0 web fonts, the
        following module can be used  instead of the built-in ``zlib`` library:  *
        `zopfli <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopfli>`__: Python bindings of    the
        Zopfli compression library.  *Extra:* ``woff``- ``Lib/fontTools/unicode.py``
        \ To display the Unicode character names when dumping the ``cmap`` table  with
        ``ttx`` we use the ``unicodedata`` module in the Standard Library.  The\_version
        included in there varies between different Python versions.  To use the latest
        available data, you can install:  * `unicodedata2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodedata2>`__:
        \   ``unicodedata`` backport for Python 3.x updated to the latest Unicode
        \   version 15.0.  *Extra:* ``unicode``- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/interpolatable.py``
        \ Module for finding wrong\_contour/component order between different masters.
        \ It requires one of the following packages in order to solve the so-called
        \ \"minimum weight perfect matching problem in bipartite graphs\", or  the
        Assignment problem:  * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`__: the
        Scientific Library    for Python, which internally uses `NumPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`__
        \   arrays and hence is very fast;  * `munkres <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres>`__:
        a pure-Python    module that implements the Hungarian or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.
        \ To plot the results to a PDF or HTML format, you also need to install:  *
        `pycairo <https://pypi.org/project/pycairo/>`__: Python bindings for the    Cairo
        graphics library. Note that wheels are currently only available for    Windows,
        for other platforms see pycairo's `installation instructions    <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`__.
        \ *Extra:* ``interpolatable``- ``Lib/fontTools/varLib/plot.py``  Module for
        visualizing DesignSpaceDocument and resulting VariationModel.  * `matplotlib
        <https://pypi.org/pypi/matplotlib>`__: 2D plotting library.  *Extra:* ``plot``-
        ``Lib/fontTools/misc/symfont.py``  Advanced module for symbolic font statistics
        analysis; it requires:  * `sympy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy>`__:
        the Python library for    symbolic mathematics.  *Extra:* ``symfont``- ``Lib/fontTools/t1Lib.py``
        \ To get the file creator\_and type of Macintosh PostScript Type 1 fonts  on
        Python 3 you need to install the following module, as the old ``MacOS``  module
        is no longer included in Mac Python:  * `xattr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr>`__:
        Python wrapper for    extended filesystem attributes (macOS platform only).
        \ *Extra:* ``type1``- ``Lib/fontTools/ttLib/removeOverlaps.py``  Simplify
        TrueType glyphs by merging overlapping contours and components.  * `skia-pathops
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypy/skia-pathops>`__: Python    bindings for the
        Skia library's PathOps module, performing boolean    operations on paths (union,
        intersection, etc.).  *Extra:* ``pathops``- ``Lib/fontTools/pens/cocoaPen.py``
        and ``Lib/fontTools/pens/quartzPen.py``  Pens for drawing glyphs with Cocoa

        release~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1) Update ``NEWS.rst`` with all the changes
        since the last release. Write a   changelog entry for each PR, with one or
        two short sentences summarizing it,   as well as links to the PR and relevant
        issues addressed by the PR. Do not   put a new title, the next command will
        do it for you.2) Use semantic versioning to decide whether the new release
        will be a 'major',   'minor' or 'patch' release. It's usually one of the latter
        two, depending on   whether new backward compatible APIs were added, or simply
        some bugs were fixed.3) Run ``python setup.py release`` command from the tip
        of the ``main`` branch.   By default this bumps the third or 'patch' digit
        only, unless you pass ``--major``   or ``--minor`` to bump respectively the
        first or second digit.   This bumps the package version string, extracts the
        changes since the latest   version from ``NEWS.rst``, and uses that text to
        create an annotated git tag   (or a signed git tag if you pass the ``--sign``
        option and your git and Github   account are configured for `signing commits
        <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits>`__
        \  using a GPG key).   It also commits an additional version bump which opens
        the main branch for   the subsequent developmental cycle4) Push both the tag
        and commit to the upstream repository, by running the command   ``git push
        --follow-tags``. Note: it may push other local tags as well, be   careful.5)
        Let the CI build the wheel and source distribution packages and verify both
        \  get uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).6) [Optional] Go to fonttools
        `Github Releases <https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/releases>`__   page
        and create a new release, copy-pasting the content of the git tag   message.
        This way, the release notes are nicely formatted as markdown, and   users
        watching the repo will get an email notification. One day we shall   automate
        that too.Acknowledgements~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In alphabetical order:aschmitz, Olivier

        order of ligature components within a ligature set, instead  of sorting by
        glyph name (#3429).- [feaLib] Fixed ordering of alternates in ``aalt`` lookups,
        following the declaration  order of feature references within the ``aalt``
        feature block (#3430).- [varLib.instancer] Fixed a bug in the instancer's
        IUP optimization (#3432).- [sbix] Support sbix glyphs with new graphicType

        same set of substitution rules to multiple features.  The ``addFeatureVariations``
        function can now take a list of featureTags; similarly, the  lib key 'com.github.fonttools.varLib.featureVarsFeatureTag'
        can now take a  comma-separateed string of feature tags (e.g. \"salt,ss01\")
        instead of a single tag (#3360).- [featureVars] Don't overwrite GSUB FeatureVariations,
        but append new records to it  for features which are not already there. But
        raise ``VarLibError`` if the feature tag  already has feature variations associated
        with it (#3363).- [varLib] Added ``addGSUBFeatureVariations`` function to

        Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to compile them
        \ from source. The pure-python wheel and source distribution will continue
        to be  published as always (pip will automatically chose them when no binary
        wheel is  available for the given platform, e.g. pypy). Use ``pip install

        \ previously the two options were involuntarily bundled together (#3012).-
        [fontBuilder] Add ``debug`` parameter to addOpenTypeFeatures method to add
        source  debugging information to the font in the ``Debg`` private table (#3008).-
        [name] Make NameRecord `__lt__` comparison not fail on Unicode encoding errors
        (#3006).- [featureVars] Fixed bug in ``overlayBox`` (#3003, #3005).- [glyf]
        Added experimental support for cubic bezier curves in TrueType glyf table,
        as  outlined in glyf v1 proposal (#2988):  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-cubicOutlines.md-
        Added new qu2cu module and related qu2cuPen, the reverse of cu2qu for converting
        \ TrueType quadratic splines to cubic bezier curves (#2993).- [glyf] Added
        experimental support for reading and writing Variable Composites/Components
        \ as defined in glyf v1 spec proposal (#2958):  https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/glyf1-varComposites.md.-
        [pens]: Added `addVarComponent` method to pen protocols' base classes, which
        pens can implement  to handle varcomponents (by default they get decomposed)
        (#2958).- [misc.transform] Added DecomposedTransform class which implements
        an affine transformation  with separate translate, rotation, scale, skew,
        and transformation-center components (#2598)- [sbix] Ensure Glyph.referenceGlyphName
        is set; fixes error after dumping and  re-compiling sbix table with 'dupe'
        glyphs (#2984).- [feaLib] Be cleverer when merging chained single substitutions
        into same lookup  when they are specified using the inline notation (#2150,
        #2974).- [instancer] Clamp user-inputted axis ranges to those of fvar (#2959).-
        [otBase/subset] Define ``__getstate__`` for BaseTable so that a copied/pickled
        'lazy'  object gets its own OTTableReader to read from; incidentally fixes
        a bug while  subsetting COLRv1 table containing ClipBoxes on python 3.11 (#2965,
        #2968).- [sbix] Handle glyphs with \"dupe\" graphic type on compile correctly
        (#2963).- [glyf] ``endPointsOfContours`` field should be unsigned! Kudos to
        behdad for  spotting one of the oldest bugs in FT. Probably nobody has ever
        dared to make  glyphs with more than 32767 points... (#2957).- [feaLib] Fixed
        handling of ``ignore`` statements with unmarked glyphs to match  makeotf behavior,
        which assumes the first glyph is marked (#2950).- Reformatted code with ``black``
        and enforce new code style via CI check (#2925).- [feaLib] Sort name table
        entries following OT spec prescribed order in the builder (#2927).- [cu2quPen]
        Add Cu2QuMultiPen that converts multiple outlines at a time in  interpolation
        compatible way; its methods take a list of tuples arguments  that would normally
        be passed to individual segment pens, and at the end it  dispatches the converted
        outlines to each pen (#2912).- [reverseContourPen/ttGlyphPen] Add outputImpliedClosingLine
        option (#2913, #2914,  #2921, #2922, #2995).- [gvar] Avoid expanding all glyphs
        unnecessarily upon compile (#2918).- [scaleUpem] Fixed bug whereby CFF2 vsindex
        was scaled; it should not (#2893, #2894).- [designspaceLib] Add DS.getAxisByTag
        and refactor getAxis (#2891).- [unicodedata] map Zmth<->math in ot_tag_{to,from}_script
        (#1737, #2889).- [woff2] Support encoding/decoding OVERLAP_SIMPLE glyf flags
        (#2576, #2884).- [instancer] Update OS/2 class and post.italicAngle when default
        moved (L4)- Dropped support for Python 3.7 which reached EOL, fontTools requires
        3.8+.- [instancer] Fixed instantiateFeatureVariations logic when a rule range
        becomes  default-applicable (#2737, #2880).- [ttLib] Add main to ttFont and
        ttCollection that just decompile and re-compile the  input font (#2869).-
        [featureVars] Insert 'rvrn' lookup at the beginning of LookupList, to work
        around bug  in Apple implementation of 'rvrn' feature which the spec says
        it should be processed  early whereas on macOS 10.15 it follows lookup order
        (#2140, #2867).- [instancer/mutator] Remove 'DSIG' table if present.- [svgPathPen]
        Don't close path in endPath(), assume open unless closePath() (#2089, #2865).4.38.0
        (released 2022-10-21)----------------------------- [varLib.instancer] Added
        support for L4 instancing, i.e. moving the default value of  an axis while
        keeping it variable. Thanks Behdad! (#2728, #2861).  It's now also possible
        to restrict an axis min/max values beyond the current default  value, e.g.
        a font wght has min=100, def=400, max=900 and you want a partial VF that  only
        varies between 500 and 700, you can now do that.  You can either specify two
        min/max values (wght=500:700), and the new default will be  set to either
        the minimum or maximum, depending on which one is closer to the current  default
        (e.g. 500 in this case). Or you can specify three values (e.g. wght=500:600:700)
        \ to specify the new default value explicitly.- [otlLib/featureVars] Set a
        few Count values so one doesn't need to compile the font  to update them (#2860).-
        [varLib.models] Make extrapolation work for 2-master models as well where
        one master  is at the default location (#2843, #2846).  Add optional extrapolate=False
        to normalizeLocation() (#2847, #2849).- [varLib.cff] Fixed sub-optimal packing
        of CFF2 deltas by no longer rounding them to  integer (#2838).- [scaleUpem]
        Calculate numShorts in VarData after scale; handle CFF hintmasks (#2840).4.37.4
        (released 2022-09-30)----------------------------- [subset] Keep nameIDs used
        by CPAL palette entry labels (#2837).- [varLib] Avoid negative hmtx values
        when creating font from variable CFF2 font (#2827).- [instancer] Don't prune
        stat.ElidedFallbackNameID (#2828).- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/Blocks to
        Unicode 15.0 (#2833).4.37.3 (released 2022-09-20)-----------------------------
        Fix arguments in calls to (glyf) glyph.draw() and drawPoints(), whereby offset
        wasn't  correctly passed down; this fix also exposed a second bug, where lsb
        and tsb were not  set (#2824, #2825, adobe-type-tools/afdko#1560).4.37.2 (released
        2022-09-15)----------------------------- [subset] Keep CPAL table and don't
        attempt to prune unused color indices if OT-SVG  table is present even if
        COLR table was subsetted away; OT-SVG may be referencing the  CPAL table;
        for now we assume that's the case (#2814, #2815).- [varLib.instancer] Downgrade
        GPOS/GSUB version if there are no more FeatureVariations  after instancing
        (#2812).- [subset] Added ``--no-lazy`` to optionally load fonts eagerly (mostly
        to ease  debugging of table lazy loading, no practical effects) (#2807).-
        [varLib] Avoid building empty COLR.DeltaSetIndexMap with only identity mappings
        (#2803).- [feaLib] Allow multiple value record types (by promoting to the
        most general format)  within the same PairPos subtable; e.g. this allows variable
        and non variable kerning  rules to share the same subtable. This also fixes
        a bug whereby some kerning pairs  would become unreachable while shapiong
        because of premature subtable splitting (#2772, #2776).- [feaLib] Speed up
        ``VarScalar`` by caching models for recurring master locations (#2798).- [feaLib]
        Optionally cythonize ``feaLib.lexer``, speeds up parsing FEA a bit (#2799).-
        [designspaceLib] Avoid crash when handling unbounded rule conditions (#2797).-
        [post] Don't crash if ``post`` legacy format 1 is malformed/improperly used
        (#2786)- [gvar] Don't be \"lazy\" (load all glyph variations up front) when
        TTFont.lazy=False (#2771).- [TTFont] Added ``normalizeLocation`` method to
        normalize a location dict from the  font's defined axes space (also known
        as \"user space\") into the normalized (-1..+1)  space. It applies ``avar``
        mapping if the font contains an ``avar`` table (#2789).- [TTVarGlyphSet] Support
        drawing glyph instances from CFF2 variable glyph set (#2784).- [fontBuilder]
        Do not error when building cmap if there are zero code points (#2785).- [varLib.plot]
        Added ability to plot a variation model and set of accompaning master  values
        corresponding to the model's master locations into a pyplot figure (#2767).-
        [Snippets] Added ``statShape.py`` script to draw statistical shape of a glyph
        as an  ellips (requires pycairo) (baecd88).- [TTVarGlyphSet] implement drawPoints
        natively, avoiding going through  SegmentToPointPen (#2778).- [TTVarGlyphSet]
        Fixed bug whereby drawing a composite glyph multiple times, its  components
        would shif; needed an extra copy (#2774).4.37.1 (released 2022-08-24)-----------------------------
        [subset] Fixed regression introduced with v4.37.0 while subsetting the VarStore
        of  ``HVAR`` and ``VVAR`` tables, whereby an ``AttributeError: subset_varidxes``
        was  thrown because an apparently unused import statement (with the side-effect
        of  dynamically binding that ``subset_varidxes`` method to the VarStore class)
        had been  accidentally deleted in an unrelated PR (#2679, #2773).- [pens]
        Added ``cairoPen`` (#2678).- [gvar] Read ``gvar`` more lazily by not parsing
        all of the ``glyf`` table (#2771).- [ttGlyphSet] Make ``drawPoints(pointPen)``
        method work for CFF fonts as well via  adapter pen (#2770).4.37.0 (released
        2022-08-23)----------------------------- [varLib.models] Reverted PR #2717
        which added support for \"narrow tents\" in v4.36.0,  as it introduced a regression
        (#2764, #2765). It will be restored in upcoming release  once we found a solution
        to the bug.- [cff.specializer] Fixed issue in charstring generalizer with
        the ``blend`` operator  (#2750, #1975).- [varLib.models] Added support for
        extrapolation (#2757).- [ttGlyphSet] Ensure the newly added ``_TTVarGlyphSet``
        inherits from ``_TTGlyphSet``  to keep backward compatibility with existing
        API (#2762).- [kern] Allow compiling legacy kern tables with more than 64k
        entries (d21cfdede).- [visitor] Added new visitor API to traverse tree of
        objects and dispatch based  on the attribute type: cf. ``fontTools.misc.visitor``
        and ``fontTools.ttLib.ttVisitor``. Added ``fontTools.ttLib.scaleUpem`` module
        that uses the latter to  change a font's units-per-em and scale all the related
        fields accordingly (#2718,  #2755).4.36.0 (released 2022-08-17)-----------------------------
        [varLib.models] Use a simpler model that generates narrower \"tents\" (regions,
        master  supports) whenever possible: specifically when any two axes that actively
        \"cooperate\"  (have masters at non-zero positions for both axes) have a complete
        set of intermediates.  The simpler algorithm produces fewer overlapping regions
        and behaves better with  respect to rounding at the peak positions than the
        generic solver, always matching  intermediate masters exactly, instead of
        maximally 0.5 units off. This may be useful  when 100% metrics compatibility
        is desired (#2218, #2717).- [feaLib] Remove warning when about ``GDEF`` not
        being built when explicitly not  requested; don't build one unconditonally
        even when not requested (#2744, also works  around #2747).- [ttFont] ``TTFont.getGlyphSet``
        method now supports selecting a location that  represents an instance of a
        variable font (supports both user-scale and normalized  axes coordinates via
        the ``normalized=False`` parameter). Currently this only works  for TrueType-flavored
        variable fonts (#2738).4.35.0 (released 2022-08-15)-----------------------------
        [otData/otConverters] Added support for 'biased' PaintSweepGradient start/end
        angles  to match latest COLRv1 spec (#2743).- [varLib.instancer] Fixed bug
        in ``_instantiateFeatureVariations`` when at the same  time pinning one axis
        and restricting the range of a subsequent axis; the wrong axis  tag was being
        used in the latter step (as the records' axisIdx was updated in the  preceding
        step but looked up using the old axes order in the following step) (#2733,
        \ #2734).- [mtiLib] Pad script tags with space when less than 4 char long
        (#1727).- [merge] Use ``'.'`` instead of ``'#'`` in duplicate glyph names
        (#2742).- [gvar] Added support for lazily loading glyph variations (#2741).-
        [varLib] In ``build_many``, we forgot to pass on ``colr_layer_reuse`` parameter
        to  the ``build`` method (#2730).- [svgPathPen] Add a main that prints SVG
        for input text (6df779fd).- [cffLib.width] Fixed off-by-one in optimized values;
        previous code didn't match the  code block above it (2963fa50).- [varLib.interpolatable]
        Support reading .designspace and .glyphs files (via optional  ``glyphsLib``).-
        Compile some modules with Cython when available and building/installing fonttools
        \ from source: ``varLib.iup`` (35% faster), ``pens.momentsPen`` (makes  ``varLib.interpolatable``
        3x faster).- [feaLib] Allow features to be built for VF without also building
        a GDEF table (e.g.  only build GSUB); warn when GDEF would be needed but isn't
        requested (#2705, 2694).- [otBase] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when uharfbuzz
        < 0.23.0 and 'repack' method is  missing (32aa8eaf). Use new ``uharfbuzz.repack_with_tag``
        when available (since  uharfbuzz>=0.30.0), enables table-specific optimizations
        to be performed during  repacking (#2724).- [statisticsPen] By default report
        all glyphs (4139d891). Avoid division-by-zero  (52b28f90).- [feaLib] Added
        missing required argument to FeatureLibError exception (#2693)- [varLib.merge]
        Fixed error during error reporting (#2689). Fixed undefined  ``NotANone``
        variable (#2714).4.34.4 (released 2022-07-07)-----------------------------
        Fixed typo in varLib/merger.py that causes NameError merging COLR glyphs  containing
        more than 255 layers (#2685).4.34.3 (released 2022-07-07)-----------------------------
        [designspaceLib] Don't make up bad PS names when no STAT data (#2684)4.34.2
        (released 2022-07-06)----------------------------- [varStore/subset] fixed
        KeyError exception to do with NO_VARIATION_INDEX while  subsetting varidxes
        in GPOS/GDEF (a08140d).4.34.1 (released 2022-07-06)-----------------------------
        [instancer] When optimizing HVAR/VVAR VarStore, use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=False
        to avoid  including NO_VARIATION_INDEX in AdvWidthMap, RsbMap, LsbMap mappings,
        which would  push the VarIdx width to maximum (4bytes), which is not desirable.
        This also fixes  a hard crash when attempting to subset a varfont after it
        had been partially instanced  with use_NO_VARIATION_INDEX=True.4.34.0 (released
        2022-07-06)----------------------------- [instancer] Set RIBBI bits in head
        and OS/2 table when cutting instances and the  subfamily nameID=2 contains
        strings like 'Italic' or 'Bold' (#2673).- [otTraverse] Addded module containing
        methods for traversing trees of otData tables  (#2660).- [otTables] Made DeltaSetIndexMap
        TTX dump less verbose by omitting no-op entries  (#2660).- [colorLib.builder]
        Added option to disable PaintColrLayers's reuse of layers from  LayerList
        (#2660).- [varLib] Added support for merging multiple master COLRv1 tables
        into a variable  COLR table (#2660, #2328). Base color glyphs of same name
        in different masters must have  identical paint graph structure (incl. number
        of layers, palette indices, number  of color line stops, corresponding paint
        formats at each level of the graph),  but can differ in the variable fields
        (e.g. PaintSolid.Alpha). PaintVar* tables  are produced when this happens
        and a VarStore/DeltaSetIndexMap is added to the  variable COLR table. It is
        possible for non-default masters to be 'sparse', i.e.  omit some of the color
        glyphs present in the default master.- [feaLib] Let the Parser set nameIDs
        1 through 6 that were previously reserved (#2675).- [varLib.varStore] Support
        NO_VARIATION_INDEX in optimizer and instancer.- [feaLib] Show all missing
        glyphs at once at end of parsing (#2665).- [varLib.iup] Rewrite force-set
        conditions and limit DP loopback length (#2651).  For Noto Sans, IUP time
        drops from 23s down to 9s, with only a slight size increase  in the final
        font. This basically turns the algorithm from O(n^3) into O(n).- [featureVars]
        Report about missing glyphs in substitution rules (#2654).- [mutator/instancer]
        Added CLI flag to --no-recalc-timestamp (#2649).- [SVG] Allow individual SVG
        documents in SVG OT table to be compressed on uncompressed,  and remember
        that when roundtripping to/from ttx. The SVG.docList is now a list  of SVGDocument
        namedtuple-like dataclass containing an extra ``compressed`` field,  and no
        longer a bare 3-tuple (#2645).- [designspaceLib] Check for descriptor types
        with hasattr() to allow custom classes  that don't inherit the default descriptors
        (#2634).- [subset] Enable sharing across subtables of extension lookups for
        harfbuzz packing  (#2626). Updated how table packing falls back to fontTools
        from harfbuzz (#2668).- [subset] Updated default feature tags following current
        Harfbuzz (#2637).- [svgLib] Fixed regex for real number to support e.g. 1e-4
        in addition to 1.0e-4.  Support parsing negative rx, ry on arc commands (#2596,
        #2611).- [subset] Fixed subsetting SinglePosFormat2 when ValueFormat=0 (#2603).4.33.3
        (released 2022-04-26)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Fixed
        typo in ``deepcopyExceptFonts`` method, preventing font  references to be
        transferred (#2600). Fixed another typo in the name of ``Range``  dataclass's
        ``__post_init__`` magic method (#2597).4.33.2 (released 2022-04-22)-----------------------------
        [otBase] Make logging less verbose when harfbuzz fails to serialize. Do not
        exit  at the first failure but continue attempting to fix offset overflow
        error using  the pure-python serializer even when the ``USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER``
        option was  explicitly set to ``True``. This is normal with fonts with relatively
        large  tables, at least until hb.repack implements proper table splitting.4.33.1
        (released 2022-04-22)----------------------------- [otlLib] Put back the ``FONTTOOLS_GPOS_COMPACT_MODE``
        environment variable to fix  regression in ufo2ft (and thus fontmake) introduced
        with v4.33.0 (#2592, #2593).  This is deprecated and will be removed one ufo2ft
        gets updated to use the new  config setup.4.33.0 (released 2022-04-21)-----------------------------
        [OS/2 / merge] Automatically recalculate ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` after merging
        \ fonts with ``fontTools.merge`` (#2591, #2538).- [misc/config] Added ``fontTools.misc.configTools``
        module, a generic configuration  system (#2416, #2439).  Added ``fontTools.config``
        module, a fontTools-specific configuration  system using ``configTools`` above.
        \ Attached a ``Config`` object to ``TTFont``.- [otlLib] Replaced environment
        variable for GPOS compression level with an  equivalent option using the new
        config system.- [designspaceLib] Incremented format version to 5.0 (#2436).
        \ Added discrete axes, variable fonts, STAT information, either design- or
        \ user-space location on instances.  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.split``
        module to split a designspace  into sub-spaces that interpolate and that represent
        the variable fonts  listed in the document.  Made instance names optional
        and allow computing them from STAT data instead.  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.statNames``
        module.  Allow instances to have the same location as a previously defined
        STAT label.  Deprecated some attributes:  ``SourceDescriptor``: ``copyLib``,
        ``copyInfo``, ``copyGroups``, ``copyFeatures``.  ``InstanceDescriptor``: ``kerning``,
        ``info``; ``glyphs``: use rules or sparse  sources.  For both, ``location``:
        use the more explicit designLocation.  Note: all are soft deprecations and
        existing code should keep working.  Updated documentation for Python methods
        and the XML format.- [varLib] Added ``build_many`` to build several variable
        fonts from a single  designspace document (#2436).  Added ``fontTools.varLib.stat``
        module to build STAT tables from a designspace  document.- [otBase] Try to
        use the Harfbuzz Repacker for packing GSUB/GPOS tables when  ``uharfbuzz``
        python bindings are available (#2552). Disable it by setting the  \"fontTools.ttLib.tables.otBase:USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER\"
        config option to ``False``.  If the option is set explicitly to ``True`` but
        ``uharfbuzz`` can't be imported  or fails to serialize for any reasons, an
        error will be raised (ImportError or  uharfbuzz errors).- [CFF/T2] Ensure
        that ``pen.closePath()`` gets called for CFF2 charstrings (#2577).  Handle
        implicit CFF2 closePath within ``T2OutlineExtractor`` (#2580).4.32.0 (released
        2022-04-08)----------------------------- [otlLib] Disable GPOS7 optimization
        to work around bug in Apple CoreText.  Always force Chaining GPOS8 for now
        (#2540).- [glifLib] Added ``outputImpliedClosingLine=False`` parameter to
        ``Glyph.draw()``,  to control behaviour of ``PointToSegmentPen`` (6b4e2e7).-
        [varLib.interpolatable] Check for wrong contour starting point (#2571).- [cffLib]

        BaseTable; useful for traversing a tree of otTables (#2551).4.30.0 (released
        2022-03-10)----------------------------- [varLib] Added debug logger showing
        the glyph name for which ``gvar`` is built (#2542).- [varLib.errors] Fixed
        undefined names in ``FoundANone`` and ``UnsupportedFormat``  exceptions (ac4d5611).-
        [otlLib.builder] Added ``windowsNames`` and ``macNames`` (bool) parameters
        to the  ``buildStatTabe`` function, so that one can select whether to only
        add one or both  of the two sets (#2528).- [t1Lib] Added the ability to recreate
        PostScript stream (#2504).- [name] Added ``getFirstDebugName``, ``getBest{Family,SubFamily,Full}Name``

        ``waitForKeyPress`` method on Windows (#2509).- [pens] Added FreeTypePen that
        uses ``freetype-py`` and the pen protocol for  rasterizating outline paths
        (#2494).- [unicodedata] Updated the script direction list to Unicode 14.0
        (#2484).  Bumped unicodedata2 dependency to 14.0 (#2499).- [psLib] Fixed type
        of ``fontName`` in ``suckfont`` (#2496).4.28.5 (released 2021-12-19)-----------------------------
        [svgPathPen] Continuation of #2471: make sure all occurrences of ``str()``
        are now  replaced with user-defined ``ntos`` callable.- [merge] Refactored
        code into submodules, plus several bugfixes and improvements:  fixed duplicate-glyph-resolution
        GSUB-lookup generation code; use tolerance in glyph  comparison for empty
        glyph's width; ignore space of default ignorable glyphs;  downgrade duplicates-resolution
        missing-GSUB from assert to warn; added --drop-tables  option (#2473, #2475,

        option to customize number formatting (e.g. rounding) (#2471).- [subset] Speed
        up subsetting of large CFF fonts (#2467).- [otTables] Speculatively promote
        lookups to extension to speed up compilation. If the  offset to lookup N is
        too big to fit in a ushort, the offset to lookup N+1 is going to  be too big
        as well, so we promote to extension all lookups from lookup N onwards (#2465).4.28.3
        (released 2021-12-03)----------------------------- [subset] Fixed bug while
        subsetting ``COLR`` table, whereby incomplete layer records  pointing to missing
        glyphs were being retained leading to ``struct.error`` upon  compiling. Make
        it so that ``glyf`` glyph closure, which follows the ``COLR`` glyph  closure,
        does not influence the ``COLR`` table subsetting (#2461, #2462).- [docs] Fully
        document the ``cmap`` and ``glyf`` tables (#2454, #2457).- [colorLib.unbuilder]
        Fixed CLI by deleting no longer existing parameter (180bb1867).4.28.2 (released

        traversing a color glyph's Paint graph when there is no  LayerList, which
        is optional (#2441).4.28.0 (released 2021-11-05)-----------------------------
        Dropped support for EOL Python 3.6, require Python 3.7 (#2417).- [ufoLib/glifLib]
        Make filename-clash checks faster by using a set instead of a list (#2422).-
        [subset] Don't crash if optional ClipList and LayerList are ``None`` (empty)
        (#2424, 2439).- [OT-SVG] Removed support for old deprecated version 1 and
        embedded color palettes,  which were never officially part of the OpenType
        SVG spec. Upon compile, reuse offsets  to SVG documents that are identical
        (#2430).- [feaLib] Added support for Variable Feature File syntax. This is
        experimental and subject  to change until it is finalized in the Adobe FEA
        spec (#2432).- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/ScriptExtensions/Blocks to UnicodeData
        14.0 (#2437).4.27.1 (released 2021-09-23)----------------------------- [otlLib]
        Fixed error when chained contextual lookup builder overflows (#2404, #2411).-
        [bezierTools] Fixed two floating-point bugs: one when computing `t` for a
        point  lying on an almost horizontal/vertical line; another when computing
        the intersection  point between a curve and a line (#2413).4.27.0 (released
        2021-09-14)----------------------------- [ttLib/otTables] Cleaned up virtual
        GID handling: allow virtual GIDs in ``Coverage``  and ``ClassDef`` readers;
        removed unused ``allowVID`` argument from ``TTFont``  constructor, and ``requireReal``
        argument in ``TTFont.getGlyphID`` method.  Make ``TTFont.setGlyphOrder`` clear
        reverse glyphOrder map, and assume ``glyphOrder``  internal attribute is never
        modified outside setGlyphOrder; added ``TTFont.getGlyphNameMany``  and ``getGlyphIDMany``
        (#1536, #1654, #2334, #2398).- [py23] Dropped internal use of ``fontTools.py23``
        module to fix deprecation warnings  in client code that imports from fontTools
        (#2234, #2399, #2400).- [subset] Fix subsetting COLRv1 clip boxes when font
        is loaded lazily (#2408).4.26.2 (released 2021-08-09)-----------------------------
        [otTables] Added missing ``CompositeMode.PLUS`` operator (#2390).4.26.1 (released
        2021-08-03)----------------------------- [transform] Added ``transformVector``
        and ``transformVectors`` methods to the  ``Transform`` class. Similar to ``transformPoint``
        but ignore the translation  part (#2386).4.26.0 (released 2021-08-03)-----------------------------
        [xmlWriter] Default to ``\"\\n\"`` for ``newlinestr`` instead of platform-specific
        \ ``os.linesep`` (#2384).- [otData] Define COLRv1 ClipList and ClipBox (#2379).-
        [removeOverlaps/instancer] Added --ignore-overlap-errors option to work around
        \ Skia PathOps.Simplify bug (#2382, #2363, google/fonts#3365).- NOTE: This
        will be the last version to support Python 3.6. FontTools will require  Python
        3.7 or above from the next release (#2350)4.25.2 (released 2021-07-26)-----------------------------
        [COLRv1] Various changes to sync with the latest CORLv1 draft spec. In particular:
        \ define COLR.VarIndexMap, remove/inline ColorIndex struct, add VarIndexBase
        to ``PaintVar*`` tables (#2372);  add reduced-precicion specialized transform
        Paints;  define Angle as fraction of half circle encoded as F2Dot14;  use
        FWORD (int16) for all Paint center coordinates;  change PaintTransform to
        have an offset to Affine2x3;- [ttLib] when importing XML, only set sfntVersion
        if the font has no reader and is empty (#2376)4.25.1 (released 2021-07-16)-----------------------------
        [ttGlyphPen] Fixed bug in ``TTGlyphPointPen``, whereby open contours (i.e.
        starting  with segmentType \"move\") would throw ``NotImplementedError``.
        They are now treated  as if they are closed, like with the ``TTGlyphPen``
        (#2364, #2366).4.25.0 (released 2021-07-05)----------------------------- [tfmLib]
        Added new library for parsing TeX Font Metric (TFM) files (#2354).- [TupleVariation]
        Make shared tuples order deterministic on python < 3.7 where  Counter (subclass
        of dict) doesn't remember insertion order (#2351, #2353).- [otData] Renamed
        COLRv1 structs to remove 'v1' suffix and match the updated draft  spec: 'LayerV1List'
        -> 'LayerList', 'BaseGlyphV1List' -> 'BaseGlyphList',  'BaseGlyphV1Record'
        -> 'BaseGlyphPaintRecord' (#2346).  Added 8 new ``PaintScale*`` tables: with/without
        centers, uniform vs non-uniform.  Added ``*AroundCenter`` variants to ``PaintRotate``
        and ``PaintSkew``: the default  versions no longer have centerX/Y, but default
        to origin.  ``PaintRotate``, ``PaintSkew`` and ``PaintComposite`` formats
        were re-numbered.  NOTE: these are breaking changes; clients using the experimental
        COLRv1 API will  have to be updated (#2348).- [pointPens] Allow ``GuessSmoothPointPen``
        to accept a tolerance. Fixed call to  ``math.atan2`` with x/y parameters inverted.
        Sync the code with fontPens (#2344).- [post] Fixed parsing ``post`` table
        format 2.0 when it contains extra garbage  at the end of the stringData array
        (#2314).- [subset] drop empty features unless 'size' with FeatureParams table
        (#2324).- [otlLib] Added ``otlLib.optimize`` module; added GPOS compaction
        algorithm.  The compaction can be run on existing fonts with ``fonttools otlLib.optimize``
        \ or using the snippet ``compact_gpos.py``. There's experimental support for
        \ compacting fonts at compilation time using an environment variable, but
        that  might be removed later (#2326).4.24.4 (released 2021-05-25)-----------------------------
        [subset/instancer] Fixed ``AttributeError`` when instantiating a VF that  contains
        GPOS ValueRecords with ``Device`` tables but without the respective  non-Device
        values (e.g. ``XAdvDevice`` without ``XAdvance``). When not  explicitly set,
        the latter are assumed to be 0 (#2323).4.24.3 (released 2021-05-20)-----------------------------
        [otTables] Fixed ``AttributeError`` in methods that split LigatureSubst,  MultipleSubst
        and AlternateSubst subtables when an offset overflow occurs.  The ``Format``
        attribute was removed in v4.22.0 (#2319).4.24.2 (released 2021-05-20)-----------------------------
        [ttGlyphPen] Fixed typing annotation of TTGlyphPen glyphSet parameter (#2315).-
        Fixed two instances of DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence (#2311).4.24.1
        (released 2021-05-20)----------------------------- [subset] Fixed AttributeError
        when SinglePos subtable has None Value (ValueFormat 0)  (#2312, #2313).4.24.0
        (released 2021-05-17)----------------------------- [pens] Add ``ttGlyphPen.TTGlyphPointPen``
        similar to ``TTGlyphPen`` (#2205).4.23.1 (released 2021-05-14)-----------------------------
        [subset] Fix ``KeyError`` after subsetting ``COLR`` table that initially contains
        \ both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset only requested v1 glyphs; we
        were  not pruning the v0 portion of the table (#2308).- [colorLib] Set ``LayerV1List``
        attribute to ``None`` when empty, it's optional  in CORLv1 (#2308).4.23.0
        (released 2021-05-13)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Allow
        to use ``\\\\UNC`` absolute paths on Windows (#2299, #2306).- [varLib.merger]
        Fixed bug where ``VarLibMergeError`` was raised with incorrect  parameters

        multiple glyphs  (#2303).- [glyf] Fixed ``NameError`` exception in ``getPhantomPoints``
        (#2295, #2305).- [removeOverlaps] Retry pathops.simplify after rounding path
        coordinates to integers  if it fails the first time using floats, to work
        around a rare and hard to debug  Skia bug (#2288).- [varLib] Added support
        for building, reading, writing and optimizing 32-bit  ``ItemVariationStore``
        as used in COLRv1 table (#2285).- [otBase/otConverters] Add array readers/writers
        for int types (#2285).- [feaLib] Allow more than one lookahead glyph/class
        in contextual positioning with  \"value at end\" (#2293, #2294).- [COLRv1]
        Default varIdx should be 0xFFFFFFFF (#2297, #2298).- [pens] Make RecordingPointPen
        actually pass on identifiers; replace asserts with  explicit ``PenError``
        exception (#2284).- [mutator] Round lsb for CF2 fonts as well (#2286).4.22.1
        (released 2021-04-26)----------------------------- [feaLib] Skip references
        to named lookups if the lookup block definition  is empty, similarly to makeotf.
        This also fixes an ``AttributeError`` while  generating ``aalt`` feature (#2276,
        #2277).- [subset] Fixed bug with ``--no-hinting`` implementation for Device
        tables (#2272,  #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping Device tables
        if no-hinting was  requested, but some Device tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000)
        are also used to encode  variation indices and need to be retained.- [otBase]
        Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when decompiling ``MVAR``  table
        with ``lazy=True`` (#2273, #2274).- [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified
        ``GlyphCoordinates`` and  ``TupleVariation`` classes, use ``bytearray`` where
        possible, refactored  phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30% speedup
        in total time  of loading master ttfs, building gvar, and saving (#2261, #2266).-
        [subset] Fixed ``AssertionError`` while pruning unused CPAL palettes when
        \ ``0xFFFF`` is present (#2257, #2259).4.22.0 (released 2021-04-01)-----------------------------
        [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst, LigatureSubst,
        \ AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).  ATTENTION: This will change your
        TTX dumps!- [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite
        as a tuple  subclass (#2201).- [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib
        (#2209).- [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error accumulation
        from  multiple deltas (#2214)- [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly
        terms (#2223, #2226)- [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)- [varLib/otlLib]

        file on disk as late as possible (#2253)- [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators
        LanguageGroup and ExpansionFactor  (#2249)  ATTENTION: This will change your
        TTX dumps!4.21.1 (released 2021-02-26)----------------------------- [pens]
        Reverted breaking change that turned ``AbstractPen`` and ``AbstractPointPen``

        building ``STAT`` table from AFDKO feature  files (#2039).- [instancer] Added
        option to update name table of generated instance using ``STAT``  table's
        axis values (#2189).- [bezierTools] Added functions to compute bezier point-at-time,
        as well as line-line,  curve-line and curve-curve intersections (#2192).4.20.0
        (released 2021-02-15)----------------------------- [COLRv1] Added ``unbuildColrV1``
        to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to raw json-able  data structure; it does the
        reverse of ``buildColrV1`` (#2171).- [feaLib] Allow ``sub X by NULL`` sequence
        to delete a glyph (#2170).- [arrayTools] Fixed ``Vector`` division (#2173).-
        [COLRv1] Define new ``PaintSweepGradient`` (#2172).- [otTables] Moved ``Paint.Format``
        enum class outside of ``Paint`` class definition,  now named ``PaintFormat``.
        It was clashing with paint instance ``Format`` attribute  and thus was breaking
        lazy load of COLR table which relies on magic ``__getattr__``  (#2175).- [COLRv1]
        Replace hand-coded builder functions with otData-driven dynamic  implementation
        (#2181).- [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats (#2181).-
        [subset] Added support for subsetting COLR v1 and CPAL tables (#2174, #2177).-
        [fontBuilder] Allow ``setupFvar`` to optionally take ``designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor``
        \ objects. Added new ``setupAvar`` method. Support localised names for axes
        and  named instances (#2185).4.19.1 (released 2021-01-28)-----------------------------
        [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now stays an off-curve
        \ point after compression.4.19.0 (released 2021-01-25)-----------------------------
        [codecs] Handle ``errors`` parameter different from 'strict' for the custom
        \ extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).- [featureVars] Raise better error
        message when a script is missing the required  default language system (#2154).-

        Fixed missing tab in ``interpolate_cff2_metrics`` (0957dc7a).4.18.0 (released
        2020-12-04)----------------------------- [COLRv1] Update to latest draft:
        added ``PaintRotate`` and ``PaintSkew`` (#2118).- [woff2] Support new ``brotlicffi``
        bindings for PyPy (#2117).- [glifLib] Added ``expectContentsFile`` parameter
        to ``GlyphSet``, for use when  reading existing UFOs, to comply with the specification
        stating that a  ``contents.plist`` file must exist in a glyph set (#2114).-
        [subset] Allow ``LangSys`` tags in ``--layout-scripts`` option (#2112). For
        example:  ``--layout-scripts=arab.dflt,arab.URD,latn``; this will keep ``DefaultLangSys``
        \ and ``URD`` language for ``arab`` script, and all languages for ``latn``
        script.- [varLib.interpolatable] Allow UFOs to be checked; report open paths,
        non existant  glyphs; add a ``--json`` option to produce a machine-readable
        list of  incompatibilities- [pens] Added ``QuartzPen`` to create ``CGPath``
        from glyph outlines on macOS.  Requires pyobjc (#2107).- [feaLib] You can
        export ``FONTTOOLS_LOOKUP_DEBUGGING=1`` to enable feature file  debugging
        info stored in ``Debg`` table (#2106).- [otlLib] Build more efficient format
        1 and format 2 contextual lookups whenever  possible (#2101).4.17.1 (released
        2020-11-16)----------------------------- [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0
        when building COLR v0 table; when color  layers are stored in UFO lib plist,
        we can't distinguish tuples from lists so  we need to accept either types
        (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).4.17.0 (released 2020-11-12)-----------------------------
        [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft ``COLR`` v1 spec (#2092).- [svgLib]
        Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not separated  by
        space or comma (#2094).- [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing',
        if the default glyph is  not empty (#2082).- [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup
        location for ``Debg`` if ``Builder.buildLookups_``  has cooperated (#2065,
        #2067).- [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).- [varLib]
        Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).- Add HashPointPen
        adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of a glyph  can be computed,
        which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).4.16.1 (released 2020-10-05)-----------------------------
        [varLib.instancer] Fixed ``TypeError`` exception when instantiating a VF with
        \ a GSUB table 1.1 in which ``FeatureVariations`` attribute is present but
        set to  ``None`` -- indicating that optional ``FeatureVariations`` is missing
        (#2077).- [glifLib] Make ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of the ``point`` element
        required  even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful ``GlifLibError``
        \ message when that happens (#2075).4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)-----------------------------
        [removeOverlaps] Added new module and ``removeOverlaps`` function that merges
        \ overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the
        \ `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.  Note
        that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).- [varLib.instancer]
        Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.  The ``overlap`` option in
        ``instantiateVariableFont`` now takes an ``OverlapMode``  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS,
        1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2: REMOVE.  The latter is equivalent
        to calling ``removeOverlaps`` on the generated static  instance. The option
        continues to accept ``bool`` value for backward compatibility.4.15.0 (released
        2020-09-21)----------------------------- [plistlib] Added typing annotations
        to plistlib module. Set up mypy static  typechecker to run automatically on
        CI (#2061).- [ttLib] Implement private ``Debg`` table, a reverse-DNS namespaced
        JSON dict.- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the ``Debg`` table with
        the original  lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination
        (if any),  and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx
        output for  a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).- [sfnt]
        Disabled checksum checking by default in ``SFNTReader`` (#2058).- [Docs] Document
        ``mtiLib`` module (#2027).- [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour
        node count and operation type  of each node (#2054).- [ttLib] Added API to
        register custom table packer/unpacker classes (#2055).4.14.0 (released 2020-08-19)-----------------------------
        [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).- [Docs]
        Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).- [ttLib] Fixed
        21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation (#2044,  #2045).-
        [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point (81d0042a).-
        [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether the
        \ optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).- [Snippets] Added
        snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF (#2030).- [otlLib] Generate
        GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where appropriate  (#2016).4.13.0
        (released 2020-07-10)----------------------------- [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup
        subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib; refactored  some common code (#2004,
        #2007).- [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).- [glifLib] Fixed bug with
        some UFO .glif filenames clashing on case-insensitive  filesystems (#2001,
        #2002).- [colorLib] Updated COLRv1 implementation following changes in the
        draft spec:  (#2008, googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec#24).4.12.1 (released
        2020-06-16)----------------------------- [_n_a_m_e] Fixed error in ``addMultilingualName``
        with one-character names.  Only attempt to recovered malformed UTF-16 data
        from a ``bytes`` string,  not from unicode ``str`` (#1997, #1998).4.12.0 (released
        2020-06-09)----------------------------- [otlLib/varLib] Ensure that the ``AxisNameID``
        in the ``STAT`` and ``fvar``  tables is grater than 255 as per OpenType spec
        (#1985, #1986).- [docs] Document more modules in ``fontTools.misc`` package:
        ``filenames``,  ``fixedTools``, ``intTools``, ``loggingTools``, ``macCreatorType``,
        ``macRes``,  ``plistlib`` (#1981).- [OS/2] Don't calculate whole sets of unicode
        codepoints, use faster and more memory  efficient ranges and bisect lookups
        (#1984).- [voltLib] Support writing back abstract syntax tree as VOLT data
        (#1983).- [voltLib] Accept DO_NOT_TOUCH_CMAP keyword (#1987).- [subset/merge]
        Fixed a namespace clash involving a private helper class (#1955).4.11.0 (released
        2020-05-28)----------------------------- [feaLib] Introduced ``includeDir``
        parameter on Parser and IncludingLexer to  explicitly specify the directory
        to search when ``include()`` statements are  encountered (#1973).- [ufoLib]
        Silently delete duplicate glyphs within the same kerning group when reading
        \ groups (#1970).- [ttLib] Set version of COLR table when decompiling COLRv1
        (commit 9d8a7e2).4.10.2 (released 2020-05-20)-----------------------------
        [sfnt] Fixed ``NameError: SimpleNamespace`` while reading TTC header. The
        regression  was introduced with 4.10.1 after removing ``py23`` star import.4.10.1
        (released 2020-05-19)----------------------------- [sfnt] Make ``SFNTReader``
        pickleable even when TTFont is loaded with lazy=True  option and thus keeps
        a reference to an external file (#1962, #1967).- [feaLib.ast] Restore backward
        compatibility (broken in 4.10 with #1905) for  ``ChainContextPosStatement``
        and ``ChainContextSubstStatement`` classes.  Make them accept either list
        of lookups or list of lists of lookups (#1961).- [docs] Document some modules
        in ``fontTools.misc`` package: ``arrayTools``,  ``bezierTools`` ``cliTools``
        and ``eexec`` (#1956).- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Fixed ``findMultilingualName()``
        when name record's ``string`` is  encoded as bytes sequence (#1963).4.10.0
        (released 2020-05-15)----------------------------- [varLib] Allow feature
        variations to be active across the entire space (#1957).- [ufoLib] Added support
        for ``formatVersionMinor`` in UFO's ``fontinfo.plist`` and for  ``formatMinor``
        attribute in GLIF file as discussed in unified-font-object/ufo-spec#78.  No
        changes in reading or writing UFOs until an upcoming (non-0) minor update
        of the  UFO specification is published (#1786).- [merge] Fixed merging fonts
        with different versions of ``OS/2`` table (#1865, #1952).- [subset] Fixed
        ``AttributeError`` while subsetting ``ContextSubst`` and ``ContextPos``  Format
        3 subtable (#1879, #1944).- [ttLib.table._m_e_t_a] if data happens to be ascii,
        emit comment in TTX (#1938).- [feaLib] Support multiple lookups per glyph
        position (#1905).- [psCharStrings] Use inheritance to avoid repeated code
        in initializer (#1932).- [Doc] Improved documentation for the following modules:
        ``afmLib`` (#1933), ``agl``  (#1934), ``cffLib`` (#1935), ``cu2qu`` (#1937),
        ``encodings`` (#1940), ``feaLib``  (#1941), ``merge`` (#1949).- [Doc] Split
        off developer-centric info to new page, making front page of docs more  user-focused.
        List all utilities and sub-modules with brief descriptions.  Make README more
        concise and focused (#1914).- [otlLib] Add function to build STAT table from
        high-level description (#1926).- [ttLib._n_a_m_e] Add ``findMultilingualName()``
        method (#1921).- [unicodedata] Update ``RTL_SCRIPTS`` for Unicode 13.0 (#1925).-
        [gvar] Sort ``gvar`` XML output by glyph name, not glyph order (#1907, #1908).-
        [Doc] Added help options to ``fonttools`` command line tool (#1913, #1920).
        \ Ensure all fonttools CLI tools have help documentation (#1948).- [ufoLib]
        Only write fontinfo.plist when there actually is content (#1911).4.9.0 (released
        2020-04-29)---------------------------- [subset] Fixed subsetting of FeatureVariations
        table. The subsetter no longer drops  FeatureVariationRecords that have empty
        substitutions as that will keep the search  going and thus change the logic.
        It will only drop empty records that occur at the  end of the FeatureVariationRecords
        array (#1881).- [subset] Remove FeatureVariations table and downgrade GSUB/GPOS
        to version 0x10000  when FeatureVariations contain no FeatureVariationRecords
        after subsetting (#1903).- [agl] Add support for legacy Adobe Glyph List of
        glyph names in ``fontTools.agl``  (#1895).- [feaLib] Ignore superfluous script
        statements (#1883).- [feaLib] Hide traceback by default on ``fonttools feaLib``
        command line.  Use ``--traceback`` option to show (#1898).- [feaLib] Check
        lookup index in chaining sub/pos lookups and print better error  message (#1896,
        #1897).- [feaLib] Fix building chained alt substitutions (#1902).- [Doc] Included
        all fontTools modules in the sphinx-generated documentation, and  published
        it to ReadTheDocs for continuous documentation of the fontTools project  (#1333).
        Check it out at https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/. Thanks to Chris Simpkins!-
        [transform] The ``Transform`` class is now subclass of ``typing.NamedTuple``.
        No  change in functionality (#1904).4.8.1 (released 2020-04-17)----------------------------
        [feaLib] Fixed ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' has no attribute 'getAlternateGlyphs'``
        \ when ``aalt`` feature references a chain contextual substitution lookup
        \ (googlefonts/fontmake#648, #1878).4.8.0 (released 2020-04-16)----------------------------
        [feaLib] If Parser is initialized without a ``glyphNames`` parameter, it cannot
        \ distinguish between a glyph name containing an hyphen, or a range of glyph
        names;  instead of raising an error, it now interprets them as literal glyph
        names, while  also outputting a logging warning to alert user about the ambiguity
        (#1768, #1870).- [feaLib] When serializing AST to string, emit spaces around
        hyphens that denote  ranges. Also, fixed an issue with CID ranges when round-tripping
        AST->string->AST  (#1872).- [Snippets/otf2ttf] In otf2ttf.py script update
        LSB in hmtx to match xMin (#1873).- [colorLib] Added experimental support
        for building ``COLR`` v1 tables as per  the `colr-gradients-spec <https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/blob/main/colr-gradients-spec.md>`__
        \ draft proposal. **NOTE**: both the API and the XML dump of ``COLR`` v1 are
        \ susceptible to change while the proposal is being discussed and formalized
        (#1822).4.7.0 (released 2020-04-03)---------------------------- [cu2qu] Added
        ``fontTools.cu2qu`` package, imported from the original  `cu2qu <https://github.com/googlefonts/cu2qu>`__
        project. The ``cu2qu.pens`` module  was moved to ``fontTools.pens.cu2quPen``.
        The optional cu2qu extension module  can be compiled by installing `Cython
        <https://cython.org/>`__ before installing  fonttools from source (i.e. git
        repo or sdist tarball). The wheel package that  is published on PyPI (i.e.
        the one ``pip`` downloads, unless ``--no-binary``  option is used), will continue
        to be pure-Python for now (#1868).4.6.0 (released 2020-03-24)----------------------------
        [varLib] Added support for building variable ``BASE`` table version 1.1 (#1858).-
        [CPAL] Added ``fromRGBA`` method to ``Color`` class (#1861).4.5.0 (released
        2020-03-20)---------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added ``add{Axis,Source,Instance,Rule}Descriptor``
        methods to  ``DesignSpaceDocument`` class, to initialize new descriptor objects
        using keyword  arguments, and at the same time append them to the current
        document (#1860).- [unicodedata] Update to Unicode 13.0 (#1859).4.4.3 (released
        2020-03-13)---------------------------- [varLib] Always build ``gvar`` table
        for TrueType-flavored Variable Fonts,  even if it contains no variation data.
        The table is required according to  the OpenType spec (#1855, #1857).4.4.2
        (released 2020-03-12)---------------------------- [ttx] Annotate ``LookupFlag``
        in XML dump with comment explaining what bits  are set and what they mean
        (#1850).- [feaLib] Added more descriptive message to ``IncludedFeaNotFound``
        error (#1842).4.4.1 (released 2020-02-26)---------------------------- [woff2]
        Skip normalizing ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables if these are missing from  a
        font (e.g. in NotoColorEmoji using ``CBDT/CBLC`` tables).- [timeTools] Use
        non-localized date parsing in ``timestampFromString``, to fix  error when
        non-English ``LC_TIME`` locale is set (#1838, #1839).- [fontBuilder] Make
        sure the CFF table generated by fontBuilder can be used by varLib  without
        having to compile and decompile the table first. This was breaking in  converting
        the CFF table to CFF2 due to some unset attributes (#1836).4.4.0 (released
        2020-02-18)---------------------------- [colorLib] Added ``fontTools.colorLib.builder``
        module, initially with ``buildCOLR``  and ``buildCPAL`` public functions.
        More color font formats will follow (#1827).- [fontBuilder] Added ``setupCOLR``
        and ``setupCPAL`` methods (#1826).- [ttGlyphPen] Quantize ``GlyphComponent.transform``
        floats to ``F2Dot14`` to fix  round-trip issue when computing bounding boxes
        of transformed components (#1830).- [glyf] If a component uses reference points
        (``firstPt`` and ``secondPt``) for  alignment (instead of X and Y offsets),
        compute the effective translation offset  *after* having applied any transform
        (#1831).- [glyf] When all glyphs have zero contours, compile ``glyf`` table
        data as a single  null byte in order to pass validation by OTS and Windows
        (#1829).- [feaLib] Parsing feature code now ensures that referenced glyph
        names are part of  the known glyph set, unless a glyph set was not provided.-
        [varLib] When filling in the default axis value for a missing location of
        a source or  instance, correctly map the value forward.- [varLib] The avar
        table can now contain mapping output values that are greater than  OR EQUAL
        to the preceeding value, as the avar specification allows this.- [varLib]
        The errors of the module are now ordered hierarchically below VarLibError.
        \ See #1821.4.3.0 (released 2020-02-03)---------------------------- [EBLC/CBLC]
        Fixed incorrect padding length calculation for Format 3 IndexSubTable  (#1817,
        #1818).- [varLib] Fixed error when merging OTL tables and TTFonts were loaded
        as ``lazy=True``  (#1808, #1809).- [varLib] Allow to use master fonts containing
        ``CFF2`` table when building VF (#1816).- [ttLib] Make ``recalcBBoxes`` option
        work also with ``CFF2`` table (#1816).- [feaLib] Don't reset ``lookupflag``
        in lookups defined inside feature blocks.  They will now inherit the current
        ``lookupflag`` of the feature. This is what  Adobe ``makeotf`` also does in
        this case (#1815).- [feaLib] Fixed bug with mixed single/multiple substitutions.
        If a single substitution  involved a glyph class, we were incorrectly using
        only the first glyph in the class  (#1814).4.2.5 (released 2020-01-29)----------------------------
        [feaLib] Do not fail on duplicate multiple substitutions, only warn (#1811).-
        [subset] Optimize SinglePos subtables to Format 1 if all ValueRecords are
        the same  (#1802).4.2.4 (released 2020-01-09)----------------------------
        [unicodedata] Update RTL_SCRIPTS for Unicode 11 and 12.4.2.3 (released 2020-01-07)----------------------------
        [otTables] Fixed bug when splitting `MarkBasePos` subtables as offsets overflow.
        \ The mark class values in the split subtable were not being updated, leading
        to  invalid mark-base attachments (#1797, googlefonts/noto-source#145).- [feaLib]
        Only log a warning instead of error when features contain duplicate  substitutions
        (#1767).- [glifLib] Strip XML comments when parsing with lxml (#1784, #1785).4.2.2
        (released 2019-12-12)---------------------------- [subset] Fixed issue with
        subsetting FeatureVariations table when the index  of features changes as
        features get dropped. The feature index need to be  remapped to point to index
        of the remaining features (#1777, #1782).- [fontBuilder] Added `addFeatureVariations`
        method to `FontBuilder` class. This  is a shorthand for calling `featureVars.addFeatureVariations`
        on the builder's  TTFont object (#1781).- [glyf] Fixed the flags bug in glyph.drawPoints()
        like we did for glyph.draw()  (#1771, #1774).4.2.1 (released 2019-12-06)----------------------------
        [glyf] Use the ``flagOnCurve`` bit mask in ``glyph.draw()``, so that we ignore
        \ the ``overlap`` flag that may be set when instantiating variable fonts (#1771).4.2.0
        (released 2019-11-28)---------------------------- [pens] Added the following
        pens:  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPen``: filter pen that rounds coordinates and
        components'    offsets to integer;  * ``roundingPen.RoundingPointPen``: like
        the above, but using PointPen protocol.  * ``filterPen.FilterPointPen``: base
        class for filter point pens;  * ``transformPen.TransformPointPen``: filter
        point pen to apply affine transform;  * ``recordingPen.RecordingPointPen``:
        records and replays point-pen commands.- [ttGlyphPen] Always round float coordinates
        and component offsets to integers  (#1763).- [ufoLib] When converting kerning
        groups from UFO2 to UFO3, avoid confusing  groups with the same name as one
        of the glyphs (#1761, #1762,  unified-font-object/ufo-spec#98).4.1.0 (released
        2019-11-18)---------------------------- [instancer] Implemented restricting
        axis ranges (level 3 partial instancing).  You can now pass ``{axis_tag: (min,
        max)}`` tuples as input to the  ``instantiateVariableFont`` function. Note
        that changing the default axis  position is not supported yet. The command-line
        script also accepts axis ranges  in the form of colon-separated float values,
        e.g. ``wght=400:700`` (#1753, #1537).- [instancer] Never drop STAT ``DesignAxis``
        records, but only prune out-of-range  ``AxisValue`` records.- [otBase/otTables]
        Enforce that VarStore.RegionAxisCount == fvar.axisCount, even  when regions
        list is empty to appease OTS < v8.0 (#1752).- [designspaceLib] Defined new
        ``processing`` attribute for ``<rules>`` element,  with values \"first\" or
        \"last\", plus other editorial changes to DesignSpace  specification. Bumped
        format version to 4.1 (#1750).- [varLib] Improved error message when masters'
        glyph orders do not match (#1758,  #1759).- [featureVars] Allow to specify
        custom feature tag in ``addFeatureVariations``;  allow said feature to already
        exist, in which case we append new lookup indices  to existing features. Implemented
        ``<rules>`` attribute ``processing`` according to  DesignSpace specification
        update in #1750. Depending on this flag, we generate  either an 'rvrn' (always
        processed first) or a 'rclt' feature (follows lookup order,  therefore last)
        (#1747, #1625, #1371).- [ttCollection] Added support for context manager auto-closing
        via ``with`` statement  like with ``TTFont`` (#1751).- [unicodedata] Require
        unicodedata2 >= 12.1.0.- [py2.py3] Removed yet more PY2 vestiges (#1743).-
        [_n_a_m_e] Fixed issue when comparing NameRecords with different string types
        (#1742).- [fixedTools] Changed ``fixedToFloat`` to not do any rounding but
        simply return  ``value / (1 << precisionBits)``. Added ``floatToFixedToStr``
        and  ``strToFixedToFloat`` functions to be used when loading from or dumping
        to XML.  Fixed values (e.g. fvar axes and instance coordinates, avar mappings,
        etc.) are  are now stored as un-rounded decimal floats upon decompiling (#1740,
        #737).- [feaLib] Fixed handling of multiple ``LigatureCaret`` statements for
        the same glyph.  Only the first rule per glyph is used, additional ones are
        ignored (#1733).4.0.2 (released 2019-09-26)---------------------------- [voltLib]
        Added support for ``ALL`` and ``NONE`` in ``PROCESS_MARKS`` (#1732).- [Silf]
        Fixed issue in ``Silf`` table compilation and decompilation regarding str
        vs  bytes in python3 (#1728).- [merge] Handle duplicate glyph names better:
        instead of appending font index to  all glyph names, use similar code like
        we use in ``post`` and ``CFF`` tables (#1729).4.0.1 (released 2019-09-11)----------------------------
        [otTables] Support fixing offset overflows in ``MultipleSubst`` lookup subtables
        \ (#1706).- [subset] Prune empty strikes in ``EBDT`` and ``CBDT`` table data
        (#1698, #1633).- [pens] Fixed issue in ``PointToSegmentPen`` when last point
        of closed contour has  same coordinates as the starting point and was incorrectly
        dropped (#1720).- [Graphite] Fixed ``Sill`` table output to pass OTS (#1705).-

        NOTE: The v4.x version series only supports Python 3.6 or greater. You can
        keep  using fonttools 3.x if you need support for Python 2.- [py23] Removed
        all the python2-only code since it is no longer reachable, thus  unused; only
        the Python3 symbols were kept, but these are no-op. The module is now  DEPRECATED
        and will removed in the future.- [ttLib] Fixed UnboundLocalError for empty
        loca/glyph tables (#1680). Also, allow  the glyf table to be incomplete when

        NOTE: This is the last scheduled release to support Python 2.7. The upcoming
        fonttools  v4.x series is going to require Python 3.6 or greater.- [varLib]
        Added new ``varLib.instancer`` module for partially instantiating variable
        \ fonts. This extends (and will eventually replace) ``varLib.mutator`` module,
        as  it allows to create not just full static instances from a variable font,
        but also  \"partial\" or \"less variable\" fonts where some of the axes are
        dropped or  instantiated at a particular value.  Also available from the command-line

        \ ``glyf`` and ``loca`` tables, as well as with transformed ``hmtx`` table.
        \ Removed ``Snippets/woff2_compress.py`` and ``Snippets/woff2_decompress.py``
        scripts,  and replaced them with a new console entry point ``fonttools ttLib.woff2``
        \ that provides two sub-commands ``compress`` and ``decompress``.- [varLib.cff]
        Fixed bug when merging CFF2 ``PrivateDicts``. The ``PrivateDict``  data from
        the first region font was incorrecty used for all subsequent fonts.  The bug
        would only affect variable CFF2 fonts with hinting (#1643, #1644).  Also,
        fixed a merging bug when VF masters have no blends or marking glyphs (#1632,
        \ #1642).- [loggingTools] Removed unused backport of ``LastResortLogger``
        class.- [subset] Gracefully handle partial MATH table (#1635).- [featureVars]

        have a ``GSUB`` table (aa8a5bc6).- [varLib] Fixed merging of class-based kerning.
        Before, the process could introduce  rogue kerning values and variations for
        random classes against class zero (everything  not otherwise classed).- [varLib]
        Fixed merging GPOS tables from master fonts with different number of  ``SinglePos``
        subtables (#1621, #1641).- [unicodedata] Updated Blocks, Scripts and ScriptExtensions

        \ ``FontMatrix`` automatically from unitsPerEm.- [plistLib] Accept the more
        general ``collections.Mapping`` instead of the  specific ``dict`` class to
        support custom data classes that should serialize  to dictionaries.3.33.0
        (released 2018-11-30)----------------------------- [subset] subsetter bug
        fix with variable fonts.- [varLib.featureVar] Improve FeatureVariations generation

        the ``fonTools.varLib.plot`` module.- [varLib] Take total bounding box into
        account when resolving model (7ee81c8).  If multiple axes have the same range
        ratio, cut across both (62003f4).- [subset] Don't error if ``STAT`` has no
        ``AxisValue`` tables.- [fontBuilder] Added a new submodule which contains
        a ``FontBuilder`` wrapper  class around ``TTFont`` that makes it easier to
        create a working TTF or OTF  font from scratch with code. NOTE: the API is
        still experimental and may  change in future versions.3.31.0 (released 2018-10-21)-----------------------------
        [ufoLib] Merged the `ufoLib <https://github.com/unified-font-objects/ufoLib>`__

        \ required in order to build a variable font (#1224, #1313).- [varLib] Implemented
        building GSUB FeatureVariations table from the ``rules``  element of DesignSpace
        document (#1240, #713, #1314).- [subset] Added ``--no-layout-closure`` option
        to not expand the subset with  the glyphs produced by OpenType layout features.

        no decimal portion (8d7774a).- [ttFont] Fixed missing import of ``TTLibError``
        exception (#1285).- [feaLib] Allow any languages other than ``dflt`` under
        ``DFLT`` script  (#1278, #1292).3.28.0 (released 2018-06-19)-----------------------------
        [featureVars] Added experimental module to build ``FeatureVariations``  tables.
        Still needs to be hooked up to ``varLib.build`` (#1240).- [fixedTools] Added
        ``otRound`` to round floats to nearest integer towards  positive Infinity.
        This is now used where we deal with visual data like X/Y  coordinates, advance
        widths/heights, variation deltas, and similar (#1274,  #1248).- [subset] Improved
        GSUB closure memoize algorithm.- [varLib.models] Fixed regression in model
        resolution (180124, #1269).- [feaLib.ast] Fixed error when converting ``SubtableStatement``
        to string  (#1275).- [varLib.mutator] Set ``OS/2.usWeightClass`` and ``usWidthClass``,
        and  ``post.italicAngle`` based on the 'wght', 'wdth' and 'slnt' axis values
        \ (#1276, #1264).- [py23/loggingTools] Don't automatically set ``logging.lastResort``
        handler  on py27. Moved ``LastResortLogger`` to the ``loggingTools`` module
        (#1277).3.27.1 (released 2018-06-11)----------------------------- [ttGlyphPen]

        [tests] Fixed issue running ttx_test.py from a tagged commit.3.27.0 (released
        2018-06-11)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added new ``conditionSet``
        element to ``rule`` element in  designspace document. Bumped ``format`` attribute
        to ``4.0`` (previously,  it was formatted as an integer). Removed ``checkDefault``,
        ``checkAxes``  methods, and any kind of guessing about the axes when the ``<axes>``
        element  is missing. The default master is expected at the intersection of
        all default  values for each axis (#1254, #1255, #1267).- [cffLib] Fixed issues
        when compiling CFF2 or converting from CFF when the  font has an FDArray (#1211,
        #1271).- [varLib] Avoid attempting to build ``cvar`` table when ``glyf`` table
        is not  present, as is the case for CFF2 fonts.- [subset] Handle None coverages
        in MarkGlyphSets; revert commit 02616ab that  sets empty Coverage tables in
        MarkGlyphSets to None, to make OTS happy.- [ttFont] Allow to build glyph order
        from ``maxp.numGlyphs`` when ``post`` or  ``cmap`` are missing.- [ttFont]
        Added ``__len__`` method to ``_TTGlyphSet``.- [glyf] Ensure ``GlyphCoordinates``
        never overflow signed shorts (#1230).- [py23] Added alias for ``itertools.izip``
        shadowing the built-in ``zip``.- [loggingTools] Memoize ``log`` property of
        ``LogMixin`` class (fbab12).- [ttx] Impoved test coverage (#1261).- [Snippets]
        Addded script to append a suffix to all family names in a font.- [varLib.plot]
        Make it work with matplotlib >= 2.1 (b38e2b).3.26.0 (released 2018-05-03)-----------------------------
        [designspace] Added a new optional ``layer`` attribute to the source element,
        \ and a corresponding ``layerName`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``
        \ object (#1253).  Added ``conditionset`` element to the ``rule`` element
        to the spec, but not  implemented in designspace reader/writer yet (#1254).-
        [varLib.models] Refine modeling one last time (0ecf5c5).- [otBase] Fixed sharing
        of tables referred to by different offset sizes  (795f2f9).- [subset] Don't
        drop a GDEF that only has VarStore (fc819d6). Set to None  empty Coverage
        tables in MarkGlyphSets (02616ab).- [varLib]: Added ``--master-finder`` command-line
        option (#1249).- [varLib.mutator] Prune fvar nameIDs from instance's name

        format, with  warning (#1236).- [varLib] Make STAT v1.2 and reuse nameIDs
        from fvar table (#1242).- [varLib.plot] Show master locations. Set axis limits
        to -1, +1.- [subset] Handle HVAR direct mapping. Passthrough 'cvar'.  Added
        ``--font-number`` command-line option for collections.- [t1Lib] Allow a text
        encoding to be specified when parsing a Type 1 font  (#1234). Added ``kind``
        argument to T1Font constructor (c5c161c).- [ttLib] Added context manager API
        to ``TTFont`` class, so it can be used in  ``with`` statements to auto-close
        the file when exiting the context (#1232).3.25.0 (released 2018-04-03)-----------------------------
        [varLib] Improved support-resolution algorithm. Previously, the on-axis  masters
        would always cut the space. They don't anymore. That's more  consistent, and
        fixes the main issue Erik showed at TYPO Labs 2017.  Any varfont built that
        had an unusual master configuration will change  when rebuilt (42bef17, a523a697,
        \ https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/264).- [varLib.models] Added
        a ``main()`` entry point, that takes positions and  prints model results.-
        [varLib.plot] Added new module to plot a designspace's  VariationModel. Requires
        ``matplotlib``.- [varLib.mutator] Added -o option to specify output file path
        (2ef60fa).- [otTables] Fixed IndexError while pruning of HVAR pre-write (6b6c34a).-
        [varLib.models] Convert delta array to floats if values overflows signed  short
        integer (0055f94).3.24.2 (released 2018-03-26)-----------------------------
        [otBase] Don't fail during ``ValueRecord`` copy if src has more items.  We
        drop hinting in the subsetter by simply changing ValueFormat, without  cleaning
        up the actual ValueRecords. This was causing assertion error if  a variable
        font was subsetted without hinting and then passed directly to  the mutator
        for instantiation without first it saving to disk.3.24.1 (released 2018-03-06)-----------------------------
        [varLib] Don't remap the same ``DeviceTable`` twice in VarStore optimizer
        \ (#1206).- [varLib] Add ``--disable-iup`` option to ``fonttools varLib``
        script,  and a ``optimize=True`` keyword argument to ``varLib.build`` function,
        \ to optionally disable IUP optimization while building varfonts.- [ttCollection]
        Fixed issue while decompiling ttc with python3 (#1207).3.24.0 (released 2018-03-01)-----------------------------
        [ttGlyphPen] Decompose composite glyphs if any components' transform is too
        \ large to fit a ``F2Dot14`` value, or clamp transform values that are  (almost)
        equal to +2.0 to make them fit and avoid decomposing (#1200,  #1204, #1205).-
        [ttx] Added new ``-g`` option to dump glyphs from the ``glyf`` table  splitted
        as individual ttx files (#153, #1035, #1132, #1202).- Copied ``ufoLib.filenames``
        module to ``fontTools.misc.filenames``, used  for the ttx split-glyphs option
        (#1202).- [feaLib] Added support for ``cvParameters`` blocks in Character
        Variant  feautures ``cv01-cv99`` (#860, #1169).- [Snippets] Added ``checksum.py``
        script to generate/check SHA1 hash of  ttx files (#1197).- [varLib.mutator]
        Fixed issue while instantiating some variable fonts  whereby the horizontal
        advance width computed from ``gvar`` phantom points  could turn up to be negative
        (#1198).- [varLib/subset] Fixed issue with subsetting GPOS variation data
        not  picking up ``ValueRecord`` ``Device`` objects (54fd71f).- [feaLib/voltLib]
        In all AST elements, the ``location`` is no longer a  required positional
        argument, but an optional kewyord argument (defaults  to ``None``). This will
        make it easier to construct feature AST from  code (#1201).3.23.0 (released
        2018-02-26)----------------------------- [designspaceLib] Added an optional
        ``lib`` element to the designspace as a  whole, as well as to the instance
        elements, to store arbitrary data in a  property list dictionary, similar
        to the UFO's ``lib``. Added an optional  ``font`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``,
        to allow operating on  in-memory font objects (#1175).- [cffLib] Fixed issue
        with lazy-loading of attributes when attempting to  set the CFF TopDict.Encoding
        (#1177, #1187).- [ttx] Fixed regression introduced in 3.22.0 that affected
        the split tables  ``-s`` option (#1188).- [feaLib] Added ``IncludedFeaNotFound``
        custom exception subclass, raised  when an included feature file cannot be
        found (#1186).- [otTables] Changed ``VarIdxMap`` to use glyph names internally
        instead of  glyph indexes. The old ttx dumps of HVAR/VVAR tables that contain
        indexes  can still be imported (21cbab8, 38a0ffb).- [varLib] Implemented VarStore
        optimizer (#1184).- [subset] Implemented pruning of GDEF VarStore, HVAR and
        MVAR (#1179).- [sfnt] Restore backward compatiblity with ``numFonts`` attribute
        of  ``SFNTReader`` object (#1181).- [merge] Initial support for merging ``LangSysRecords``
        (#1180).- [ttCollection] don't seek(0) when writing to possibly unseekable
        strems.- [subset] Keep all ``--name-IDs`` from 0 to 6 by default (#1170, #605,
        #114).- [cffLib] Added ``width`` module to calculate optimal CFF default and
        \ nominal glyph widths.- [varLib] Don\u2019t fail if STAT already in the master
        fonts (#1166).3.22.0 (released 2018-02-04)----------------------------- [subset]
        Support subsetting ``endchar`` acting as ``seac``-like components  in ``CFF``
        (fixes #1162).- [feaLib] Allow to build from pre-parsed ``ast.FeatureFile``
        object.  Added ``tables`` argument to only build some tables instead of all
        (#1159,  #1163).- [textTools] Replaced ``safeEval`` with ``ast.literal_eval``
        (#1139).- [feaLib] Added option to the parser to not resolve ``include`` statements
        \ (#1154).- [ttLib] Added new ``ttCollection`` module to read/write TrueType
        and  OpenType Collections. Exports a ``TTCollection`` class with a ``fonts``
        \ attribute containing a list of ``TTFont`` instances, the methods ``save``
        \ and ``saveXML``, plus some list-like methods. The ``importXML`` method is
        \ not implemented yet (#17).- [unicodeadata] Added ``ot_tag_to_script`` function
        that converts from  OpenType script tag to Unicode script code.- Added new
        ``designspaceLib`` subpackage, originally from Erik Van Blokland's  ``designSpaceDocument``:
        https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument  NOTE: this is not yet used
        internally by varLib, and the API may be subject  to changes (#911, #1110,
        LettError/designSpaceDocument#28).- Added new FontTools icon images (8ee7c32).-
        [unicodedata] Added ``script_horizontal_direction`` function that returns
        \ either \"LTR\" or \"RTL\" given a unicode script code.- [otConverters] Don't
        write descriptive name string as XML comment if the  NameID value is 0 (==
        NULL) (#1151, #1152).- [unicodedata] Add ``ot_tags_from_script`` function
        to get the list of  OpenType script tags associated with unicode script code
        (#1150).- [feaLib] Don't error when \"enumerated\" kern pairs conflict with
        preceding  single pairs; emit warning and chose the first value (#1147, #1148).-

        formatted log message.- [sbix] Fixed TypeError when concatenating str and
        bytes (#1154).- [bezierTools] Implemented cusp support and removed ``approximate_fallback``
        \ arg in ``calcQuadraticArcLength``. Added ``calcCubicArcLength`` (#1142).3.21.2

        number (1aafae8).- Change FontTools licence to MIT (#1127).- [post] Prune
        extra names already in standard Mac set (df1e8c7).- [subset] Delete empty
        SubrsIndex after subsetting (#994, #1118).- [varLib] Don't share points in
        cvar by default, as it currently fails on  some browsers (#1113).- [afmLib]
        Make poor old afmLib work on python3.3.20.1 (released 2017-11-22)-----------------------------
        [unicodedata] Fixed issue with ``script`` and ``script_extension`` functions
        \ returning inconsistent short vs long names. They both return the short four-
        \ letter script codes now. Added ``script_name`` and ``script_code`` functions
        \ to look up the long human-readable script name from the script code, and
        \ viceversa (#1109, #1111).3.20.0 (released 2017-11-21)-----------------------------
        [unicodedata] Addded new module ``fontTools.unicodedata`` which exports the
        \ same interface as the built-in ``unicodedata`` module, with the addition
        of  a few functions that are missing from the latter, such as ``script``,
        \ ``script_extension`` and ``block``. Added a ``MetaTools/buildUCD.py`` script
        \ to download and parse data files from the Unicode Character Database and
        \ generate python modules containing lists of ranges and property values.-
        [feaLib] Added ``__str__`` method to all ``ast`` elements (delegates to the
        \ ``asFea`` method).- [feaLib] ``Parser`` constructor now accepts a ``glyphNames``
        iterable  instead of ``glyphMap`` dict. The latter still works but with a
        pending  deprecation warning (#1104).- [bezierTools] Added arc length calculation
        functions originally from  ``pens.perimeterPen`` module (#1101).- [varLib]
        Started generating STAT table (8af4309). Right now it just reflects  the axes,
        and even that with certain limitations:  * AxisOrdering is set to the order
        axes are defined,  * Name-table entries are not shared with fvar.- [py23]
        Added backports for ``redirect_stdout`` and ``redirect_stderr``  context managers

        [varLib] Try set of used points instead of all points when testing whether
        to  share points between tuples (#1090).- [CFF2] Fixed issue with reading/writing
        PrivateDict BlueValues to TTX file.  Read the commit message 8b02b5a and issue
        #1030 for more details.  NOTE: this change invalidates all the TTX files containing
        CFF2 tables  that where dumped with previous verisons of fonttools.  CFF2
        Subr items can have values on the stack after the last operator, thus  a ``CFF2Subr``
        class was added to accommodate this (#1091).- [_k_e_r_n] Fixed compilation
        of AAT kern version=1.0 tables (#1089, #1094)- [ttLib] Added getBestCmap()
        convenience method to TTFont class and cmap table  class that returns a preferred
        Unicode cmap subtable given a list of options  (#1092).- [morx] Emit more
        meaningful subtable flags. Implement InsertionMorphAction3.18.0 (released
        2017-10-30)----------------------------- [feaLib] Fixed writing back nested

        Fixed issue with ``unicode_literals`` and ``struct`` module in  old versions
        of python 2.7 (#993).3.17.0 (released 2017-10-16)-----------------------------
        [svgPathPen] Added an ``SVGPathPen`` that translates segment pen commands
        \ into SVG path descriptions. Copied from Tal Leming's ``ufo2svg.svgPathPen``
        \ https://github.com/typesupply/ufo2svg/blob/d69f992/Lib/ufo2svg/svgPathPen.py-
        [reverseContourPen] Added ``ReverseContourPen``, a filter pen that draws  contours
        with the winding direction reversed, while keeping the starting  point (#1071).-
        [filterPen] Added ``ContourFilterPen`` to manipulate contours as a whole  rather
        than segment by segment.- [arrayTools] Added ``Vector`` class to apply math
        operations on an array  of numbers, and ``pairwise`` function to loop over
        pairs of items in an  iterable.- [varLib] Added support for building and interpolation

        Graphite font tables: Feat, Glat, Gloc, Silf and Sill.  Thanks @mhosken! (#1054).-
        [varLib] Default to using axis \"name\" attribute if \"labelname\" element
        \ is missing (588f524).- [merge] Added support for merging Script records.
        Remove unused features  and lookups after merge (d802580, 556508b).- Added
        ``fontTools.svgLib`` package. Includes a parser for SVG Paths that  supports

        that decompile a lazy list before adding  it to another list or ``_LazyList``
        instance. Fixes an ``AttributeError``  in the ``subset`` module when attempting
        to sum ``_LazyList`` objects  (6ef48bd2, 1aef1683).- [AAT] Support the `opbd`
        table with optical bounds (a47f6588).- [AAT] Support `prop` table with glyph

        Added ``mapped`` keyword argument to  ``interpolate_layout`` to allow disabling
        avar mapping: if False (default),  the location is mapped using the map element
        of the axes in designspace file;  if True, it is assumed that location is
        in designspace's internal space and  no mapping is performed (#950, #975).-

        (released 2017-05-03)----------------------------- [t2CharStringPen] Initial
        support for specialized Type2 path operators:  vmoveto, hmoveto, vlineto,
        hlineto, vvcurveto, hhcurveto, vhcurveto and  hvcurveto. This should produce
        more compact charstrings (#940, #403).- [Doc] Added Sphinx sources for the

        (#888)- [varLib] Do not encode gvar deltas that are all zeroes, or if all
        values  are smaller than tolerance.- [ttLib] _TTGlyphSet glyphs now also have
        ``height`` and ``tsb`` (top  side bearing) attributes from the ``vmtx`` table,
        if present.- [glyf] In ``GlyphCoordintes`` class, added ``__bool__`` / ``__nonzero__``
        \ methods, and ``array`` property to get raw array.- [ttx] Support reading

        [ttLib] Added support for reading/writing ``CFF2`` table (thanks to  @readroberts
        at Adobe), and ``TTFA`` (ttfautohint) table.- [varLib] Fixed regression introduced
        with 3.8.0 in the calculation of  ``NumShorts``, i.e. the number of deltas
        in ItemVariationData's delta sets  that use a 16-bit\_representation (b2825ff).3.8.0
        (released 2017-03-05)---------------------------- New pens: MomentsPen, StatisticsPen,

        [varLib] Added experimental ``fontTools.varLib.interpolatable`` module for
        \ finding wrong contour order between different masters- [varLib] designspace.load()
        now returns a dictionary, instead of a tuple,  and supports <axes> element
        (#864); the 'masters' item was renamed 'sources',  like the <sources> element
        in the designspace document- [ttLib] Fixed issue with recalculating ``head``
        modified timestamp when  saving CFF fonts- [ttLib] In TupleVariation, round

        in classes used as MarkFilteringSet and  MarkAttachmentType (#863)- [merge]
        Changed the ``gasp`` table merge logic so that only the one from  the first
        font is retained, similar to other hinting tables (#862)- [Tests] Added tests
        for the ``varLib`` package, as well as test fonts  from the \"Annotated OpenType
        Specification\" (AOTS) to exercise ``ttLib``'s  table readers/writers (<https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/aots>)3.7.2

        code in the fpgm, prep, and glyf tables is now indented in   XML output for
        improved readability. The ``instruction`` element is   written as a simple
        tag if empty (#819).-  [ttx] Fixed 'I/O operation on closed file' error when
        dumping   multiple TTXs to standard output with the '-o -' option.-  The unit
        test modules (``*_test.py``) have been moved outside of the   fontTools package
        to the Tests folder, thus they are no longer   installed (#811).3.5.0 (released
        2017-01-14)----------------------------  Font tables read from XML can now

        (#794, fixes #773).-  [feaLib] Added ``feaLib`` command to the 'fonttools'
        command-line   tool; applies a feature file to a font. ``fonttools feaLib
        -h`` for   help.-  [pens] The ``T2CharStringPen`` now takes an optional   ``roundTolerance``
        argument to control the rounding of coordinates   (#804, fixes #769).-  [ci]

        (released 2016-12-15)----------------------------  [setup] We no longer use
        versioneer.py to compute fonttools version   from git metadata, as this has
        caused issues for some users (#767).   Now we bump the version strings manually
        with a custom ``release``   command of setup.py script.3.3.0 (released 2016-12-06)----------------------------
        \ [ttLib] Implemented STAT table from OpenType 1.8 (#758)-  [cffLib] Fixed

        \ [py23] optimized performance of round3 function; added backport for   py35
        math.isclose() (9d8dacb)-  [subset] fixed issue with 'narrow' (UCS-2) Python
        2 builds and   ``--text``/``--text-file`` options containing non-BMP chararcters
        \  (16d0e5e)-  [varLib] fixed issuewhen normalizing location values (8fa2ee1,
        #749)-  [inspect] Made it compatible with both python2 and python3 (167ee60,
        \  #748). Thanks @pnemade3.2.2 (released 2016-11-24)----------------------------
        \ [varLib] Do not emit null axes in fvar (1bebcec). Thanks @robmck-ms-  [varLib]

        \ [OS/2] fix checking ``fsSelection`` bits matching ``head.macStyle``   bits-
        \ [varLib] added ``--build-HVAR`` option to generate ``HVAR`` table for   fonts
        with TrueType outlines. For ``CFF2``, it is enabled by default.3.2.0 (released
        2016-11-02)----------------------------  [varLib] Improve support for OpenType
        1.8 Variable Fonts:-  Implement GDEF's VariationStore-  Implement HVAR/VVAR

        in   XML output for GSUB, GPOS, GDEF, MATH, BASE, JSTF, HVAR, VVAR, feat,
        \  hhea and vhea tables. Scripts that set the Version for those to 1.0   or
        other float values also need fixing. A warning is emitted when   code or XML
        needs fix.-  several bug fixes to the cffLib module, contributed by Adobe's
        \  @readroberts-  The XML output for CFF table now has a 'major' and 'minor'
        elements   for specifying whether it's version 1.0 or 2.0 (support for CFF2
        is   coming soon)-  [setup.py] remove undocumented/deprecated ``extra_path``
        Distutils   argument. This means that we no longer create a \"FontTools\"
        subfolder   in site-packages containing the actual fontTools package, as well
        as   the standalone xmlWriter and sstruct modules. The latter modules are
        \  also deprecated, and scheduled for removal in upcoming releases.   Please
        change your import statements to point to from fontTools.misc   import xmlWriter
        and from fontTools.misc import sstruct.-  [scripts] Add a 'fonttools' command-line
        tool that simply runs   ``fontTools.*`` sub-modules: e.g. ``fonttools ttx``,
        \  ``fonttools subset``, etc.-  [hmtx/vmts] Read advance width/heights as
        unsigned short (uint16);   automatically round float values to integers.-
        \ [ttLib/xmlWriter] add 'newlinestr=None' keyword argument to   ``TTFont.saveXML``
        for overriding os-specific line endings (passed on   to ``XMLWriter`` instances).-
        \ [versioning] Use versioneer instead of ``setuptools_scm`` to   dynamically
        load version info from a git checkout at import time.-  [feaLib] Support backslash-prefixed
        glyph names.3.1.2 (released 2016-09-27)----------------------------  restore
        Makefile as an alternative way to build/check/install-  README.md: update
        instructions for installing package from source,   and for running test suite-
        \ NEWS: Change log was out of sync with tagged release3.1.1 (released 2016-09-27)----------------------------
        \ Fix ``ttLibVersion`` attribute in TTX files still showing '3.0'   instead

        ``symfont.py``, for symbolic font statistics analysis;   interpolatable.py,
        a preliminary script for detecting interpolation   errors; ``{merge,dump}_woff_metadata.py``.-
        \ [classifyTools] Helpers to classify things into classes.-  [CI] Run tests
        on Windows, Linux and macOS using Appveyor and Travis   CI; check unit test
        coverage with Coverage.py/Coveralls; automatic   deployment to PyPI on tags.-

        support-  Python 2.6 support-  Update Unicode data to 5.2.0-  Couple of bug
        fixes2.2 (released 2008-05-18)--------------------------  ClearType support-
        \ cmap format 1 support-  PFA font support-  Switched from Numeric to numpy-
        \ Update Unicode data to 5.1.0-  Update AGLFN data to 1.6-  Many bug fixes2.1
        (released 2008-01-28)--------------------------  Many years worth of fixes
        and features2.0b2 (released 2002-??-??)----------------------------  Be \"forgiving\"
        when interpreting the maxp table version field:   interpret any value as 1.0
        if it's not 0.5. Fixes dumping of these   GPL fonts: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/chinese/wangttf-
        \ Fixed ttx -l: it turned out this part of the code didn't work with   Python
        2.2.1 and earlier. My bad to do most of my testing with a   different version
        than I shipped TTX with :-(-  Fixed bug in ClassDef format 1 subtable (Andreas
        Seidel bumped into   this one).2.0b1 (released 2002-09-10)----------------------------
        \ Fixed embarrassing bug: the master checksum in the head table is now   calculated
        correctly even on little-endian platforms (such as Intel).-  Made the cmap
        format 4 compiler smarter: the binary data it creates   is now more or less
        as compact as possible. TTX now makes more   compact data than in any shipping
        font I've tested it with.-  Dump glyph names as a separate \"GlyphOrder\"
        pseudo table as opposed   to as part of the glyf table (obviously needed for
        CFF-OTF's).-  Added proper support for the CFF table.-  Don't barf on empty
        tables (questionable, but \"there are font out   there...\")-  When writing
        TT glyf data, align glyphs on 4-byte boundaries. This   seems to be the current
        recommendation by MS. Also: don't barf on   fonts which are already 4-byte
        aligned.-  Windows installer contributed bu Adam Twardoch! Yay!-  Changed
        the command line interface again, now by creating one new   tool replacing
        the old ones: ttx It dumps and compiles, depending on   input file types.
        The options have changed somewhat.-  The -d option is back (output dir)-  ttcompile's
        -i options is now called -m (as in \"merge\"), to avoid   clash with dump's
        -i.-  The -s option (\"split tables\") no longer creates a directory, but
        \  instead outputs a small .ttx file containing references to the   individual
        table files. This is not a true link, it's a simple file   name, and the referenced
        file should be in the same directory so   ttcompile can find them.-  compile
        no longer accepts a directory as input argument. Instead it   can parse the
        new \"mini-ttx\" format as output by \"ttx -s\".-  all arguments are input
        files-  Renamed the command line programs and moved them to the Tools   subdirectory.
        They are now installed by the setup.py install script.-  Added OpenType support.
        BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and JSTF are (almost)   fully supported. The XML output
        is not yet final, as I'm still   considering to output certain subtables in
        a more human-friendly   manner.-  Fixed 'kern' table to correctly accept subtables
        it doesn't know   about, as well as interpreting Apple's definition of the
        'kern' table   headers correctly.-  Fixed bug where glyphnames were not calculated
        from 'cmap' if it was   (one of the) first tables to be decompiled. More specifically:
        it   cmap was the first to ask for a glyphID -> glyphName mapping.-  Switched
        XML parsers: use expat instead of xmlproc. Should be faster.-  Removed my
        UnicodeString object: I now require Python 2.0 or up,   which has unicode
        support built in.-  Removed assert in glyf table: redundant data at the end
        of the table   is now ignored instead of raising an error. Should become a
        warning.-  Fixed bug in hmtx/vmtx code that only occured if all advances were
        \  equal.-  Fixed subtle bug in TT instruction disassembler.-  Couple of fixes
        to the 'post' table.-  Updated OS/2 table to latest spec.1.0b1 (released 2001-08-10)----------------------------
        \ Reorganized the command line interface for ttDump.py and   ttCompile.py,
        they now behave more like \"normal\" command line tool,   in that they accept
        multiple input files for batch processing.-  ttDump.py and ttCompile.py don't
        silently override files anymore, but   ask before doing so. Can be overridden
        by -f.-  Added -d option to both ttDump.py and ttCompile.py.-  Installation
        is now done with distutils. (Needs work for environments   without compilers.)-
        \ Updated installation instructions.-  Added some workarounds so as to handle
        certain buggy fonts more   gracefully.-  Updated Unicode table to Unicode
        3.0 (Thanks Antoine!)-  Included a Python script by Adam Twardoch that adds
        some useful stuff   to the Windows registry.-  Moved the project to SourceForge.1.0a6
        (released 2000-03-15)----------------------------  Big reorganization: made
        ttLib a subpackage of the new fontTools   package, changed several module
        names. Called the entire suite   \"FontTools\"-  Added several submodules
        to fontTools, some new, some older.-  Added experimental CFF/GPOS/GSUB support
        to ttLib, read-only (but XML   dumping of GPOS/GSUB is for now disabled)-
        \ Fixed hdmx endian bug-  Added -b option to ttCompile.py, it disables recalculation
        of   bounding boxes, as requested by Werner Lemberg.-  Renamed tt2xml.pt to
        ttDump.py and xml2tt.py to ttCompile.py-  Use \".ttx\" as file extension instead
        of \".xml\".-  TTX is now the name of the XML-based *format* for TT fonts,
        and not   just an application.1.0a5-----Never released-  More tables supported:
        hdmx, vhea, vmtx1.0a3 & 1.0a4-------------Never released-  fixed most portability
        issues-  retracted the \"Euro_or_currency\" change from 1.0a2: it was   nonsense!1.0a2
        (released 1999-05-02)----------------------------  binary release for MacOS-
        \ genenates full FOND resources: including width table, PS font name   info
        and kern table if applicable.-  added cmap format 4 support. Extra: dumps
        Unicode char names as XML   comments!-  added cmap format 6 support-  now
        accepts true type files starting with \"true\" (instead of just   0x00010000
        and \"OTTO\")-  'glyf' table support is now complete: I added support for
        composite   scale, xy-scale and two-by-two for the 'glyf' table. For now,
        \  component offset scale behaviour defaults to Apple-style. This only   affects
        the (re)calculation of the glyph bounding box.-  changed \"Euro\" to \"Euro_or_currency\"
        in the Standard Apple Glyph   order list, since we cannot tell from the 'post'
        table which is   meant. I should probably doublecheck with a Unicode encoding
        if   available. (This does not affect the output!)Fixed bugs: - 'hhea' table
        is now recalculated correctly - fixed wrongassumption about sfnt resource
        names1.0a1 (released 1999-04-27)----------------------------  initial binary
        release for MacOS"

        package facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions inthe
        DOT_ language of the Graphviz_ graph drawing software (`upstream repo`_)from
        Python.Create a graph object, assemble the graph by adding nodes and edges,
        andretrieve its DOT source code string. Save the source code to a file and
        renderit with the Graphviz installation of your system.Use the ``view`` option/method
        to directly inspect the resulting (PDF, PNG,SVG, etc.) file with its default
        application. Graphs can also be renderedand displayed within `Jupyter notebooks`_
        (formerly known as`IPython notebooks`_,`example <notebook_>`_, `nbviewer <notebook-nbviewer_>`_)as

        Tracker: https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz/issues- Download: https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/#filesInstallation------------This
        package runs under Python 3.8+, use pip_ to install:.. code:: bash    $ pip
        install graphvizTo render the generated DOT source code, you also need to
        install Graphviz_(`download page <upstream-download_>`_,`archived versions
        <upstream-archived_>`_,`installation procedure for Windows <upstream-windows_>`_).Make
        sure that the directory containing the ``dot`` executable is on yoursystems''
        ``PATH``(sometimes done by the installer;setting ``PATH``on `Linux <set-path-linux_>`_,`Mac
        <set-path-darwin_>`_,and `Windows <set-path-windows_>`_).Anaconda_: see the
        conda-forge_ package`conda-forge/python-graphviz <conda-forge-python-graphviz_>`_(`feedstock
        <conda-forge-python-graphviz-feedstock_>`_),which should automatically ``conda
        install```conda-forge/graphviz <conda-forge-graphviz_>`_(`feedstock <conda-forge-graphviz-feedstock_>`_)
        as dependency.Quickstart----------Create a graph object:.. code:: python    >>>
        import graphviz  # doctest: +NO_EXE    >>> dot = graphviz.Digraph(comment=''The
        Round Table'')    >>> dot  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS    <graphviz.graphs.Digraph
        object at 0x...>Add nodes and edges:.. code:: python    >>> dot.node(''A'',
        ''King Arthur'')  # doctest: +NO_EXE    >>> dot.node(''B'', ''Sir Bedevere
        the Wise'')    >>> dot.node(''L'', ''Sir Lancelot the Brave'')    >>> dot.edges([''AB'',
        ''AL''])    >>> dot.edge(''B'', ''L'', constraint=''false'')Check the generated
        source code:.. code:: python    >>> print(dot.source)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        +NO_EXE    // The Round Table    digraph {        A [label="King Arthur"]        B
        [label="Sir Bedevere the Wise"]        L [label="Sir Lancelot the Brave"]        A
        -> B        A -> L        B -> L [constraint=false]    }Save and render the
        source code (skip/ignore any ``doctest_mark_exe()`` lines):.. code:: python    >>>
        doctest_mark_exe()  # skip this line    >>> dot.render(''doctest-output/round-table.gv'').replace(''\\'',
        ''/'')    ''doctest-output/round-table.gv.pdf''Save and render and view the
        result:.. code:: python    >>> doctest_mark_exe()  # skip this line    >>>

        https://codecov.io/gh/joblib/joblib   :alt: Codecov coverageThe homepage of
        joblib with user documentation is located on:https://joblib.readthedocs.ioGetting
        the latest code=======================To get the latest code using git, simply
        type::    git clone https://github.com/joblib/joblib.gitIf you don''t have
        git installed, you can download a zipof the latest code: https://github.com/joblib/joblib/archive/refs/heads/master.zipInstalling==========You
        can use `pip` to install joblib::    pip install joblibfrom any directory
        or::    python setup.py installfrom the source directory.Dependencies============-
        Joblib has no mandatory dependencies besides Python (supported versions are  3.8+).-
        Joblib has an optional dependency on Numpy (at least version 1.6.1) for array  manipulation.-
        Joblib includes its own vendored copy of  `loky <https://github.com/tomMoral/loky>`_
        for process management.- Joblib can efficiently dump and load numpy arrays
        but does not require numpy  to be installed.- Joblib has an optional dependency
        on  `python-lz4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lz4>`_ as a faster alternative
        to  zlib and gzip for compressed serialization.- Joblib has an optional dependency
        on psutil to mitigate memory leaks in  parallel worker processes.- Some examples
        require external dependencies such as pandas. See the  instructions in the
        `Building the docs`_ section for details.Workflow to contribute======================To
        contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github<https://github.com/>`_.
        Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository<https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_
        to have your own repository,clone it using ''git clone'' on the computers
        where you want to work. Makeyour changes in your clone, push them to your
        github account, test themon several computers, and when you are happy with
        them, send a pullrequest to the main repository.Running the test suite======================To
        run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.Run
        the test suite using::    pytest joblibfrom the root of the project.Building
        the docs=================To build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4)
        and some dependenciesinstalled::    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txtThe
        docs can then be built with the following command::    make docThe html docs
        are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.Making a source tarball=======================To
        create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run thefollowing
        command::    python setup.py sdistThe tarball will be created in the `dist`
        directory. This command willcompile the docs, and the resulting tarball can
        be installed withno extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You
        will needsetuptool and sphinx.Making a release and uploading it to PyPI=========================================This
        command is only run by project manager, to make a release, andupload in to
        PyPI::    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel    twine upload dist/*Note that
        the documentation should automatically get updated at each gitpush. If that
        is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolveany doc build error
        (in particular when running the examples).Updating the changelog======================Changes
        are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updatedbut, the
        following git command may be used to generate the lines::    git log --abbrev-commit
        --date=short --no-merges --sparse'

        StatusKiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
        solvingalgorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the`seminal
        Cassowary paper <https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf>`_.It
        is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi has been designedfrom
        the ground up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi ranges from 10x to 500xfaster
        than the original Cassowary solver with typical use cases gaining a 40ximprovement.
        Memory savings are consistently > 5x.In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships
        with hand-rolled Python bindings forPython 3.7+.'

        What is it?**pandas** is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and
        expressive datastructures designed to make working with \"relational\" or
        \"labeled\" data botheasy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level
        building block fordoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python.
        Additionally, it hasthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible
        open source dataanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**.
        It is already well onits way towards this goal.## Main FeaturesHere are just
        a few of the things that pandas does well:  - Easy handling of [**missing
        data**][missing-data] (represented as    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating
        point as well as non-floating point data  - Size mutability: columns can be
        [**inserted and    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher
        dimensional    objects  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]:
        objects can    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
        \   ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically    align
        the data for you in computations  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby]
        functionality to perform    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for
        both aggregating    and transforming data  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion]
        ragged,    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures
        \   into DataFrame objects  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing],
        [**fancy    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting]
        of    large data sets  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining]
        data    sets  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table]
        of    data sets  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have
        multiple    labels per tick)  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat
        files**][flat-files]    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],
        \   and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]
        \ - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range    generation
        and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,    date shifting and lagging

        OverviewThe Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your
        Python interpreter.This library provides extensive file format support, an
        efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.The
        core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic
        pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing
        tool.## More Information- [Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)  -

        [Community forum](https://community.plotly.com)---## Installationplotly.py
        may be installed using pip...```pip install plotly==5.20.0```or conda.```conda
        install -c plotly plotly=5.20.0```### JupyterLab SupportFor use in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
        install the `jupyterlab` and `ipywidgets`packages using `pip`:```pip install
        "jupyterlab>=3" "ipywidgets>=7.6"```or `conda`:```conda install "jupyterlab>=3"
        "ipywidgets>=7.6"```The instructions above apply to JupyterLab 3.x. **For
        JupyterLab 2 or earlier**, run the following commands to install the required
        JupyterLab extensions (note that this will require [`node`](https://nodejs.org/)
        to be installed):```# JupyterLab 2.x renderer supportjupyter labextension
        install jupyterlab-plotly@5.20.0 @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager```Please
        check out our [Troubleshooting guide](https://plotly.com/python/troubleshooting/)
        if you run into any problems with JupyterLab.### Jupyter Notebook SupportFor
        use in the Jupyter Notebook, install the `notebook` and `ipywidgets`packages
        using `pip`:```pip install "notebook>=5.3" "ipywidgets>=7.5"```or `conda`:```conda
        install "notebook>=5.3" "ipywidgets>=7.5"```### Static Image Exportplotly.py
        supports [static image export](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/),using
        either the [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido)package (recommended,
        supported as of `plotly` version 4.9) or the [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)command
        line utility (legacy as of `plotly` version 4.9).#### KaleidoThe [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido)
        package has no dependencies and can be installedusing pip...```pip install
        -U kaleido```or conda.```conda install -c conda-forge python-kaleido```####
        OrcaWhile Kaleido is now the recommended image export approach because it
        is easier to installand more widely compatible, [static image export](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/)can
        also be supportedby the legacy [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca) command
        line utility and the [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) Python
        package.These dependencies can both be installed using conda:```conda install
        -c plotly plotly-orca==1.3.1 psutil```Or, `psutil` can be installed using
        pip...```pip install psutil```and orca can be installed according to the instructions
        in the [orca README](https://github.com/plotly/orca).### Extended Geo SupportSome
        plotly.py features rely on fairly large geographic shape files. The countychoropleth
        figure factory is one such example. These shape files are distributed as aseparate
        `plotly-geo` package. This package can be installed using pip...```pip install
        plotly-geo==1.0.0```or conda```conda install -c plotly plotly-geo=1.0.0```##
        MigrationIf you''re migrating from plotly.py v3 to v4, please check out the
        [Version 4 migration guide](https://plotly.com/python/v4-migration/)If you''re
        migrating from plotly.py v2 to v3, please check out the [Version 3 migration

      Description: 'PyParsing -- A Python Parsing Module====================================|Version|
        |Build Status| |Coverage| |License| |Python Versions| |Snyk Score|Introduction============The
        pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating andexecuting simple
        grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or theuse of regular expressions.
        The pyparsing module provides a library ofclasses that client code uses to
        construct the grammar directly inPython code.*[Since first writing this description
        of pyparsing in late 2003, thistechnique for developing parsers has become
        more widespread, under thename Parsing Expression Grammars - PEGs. See more
        information on PEGs*`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar>`__*.]*Here
        is a program to parse ``"Hello, World!"`` (or any greeting of the form``"salutation,
        addressee!"``):.. code:: python    from pyparsing import Word, alphas    greet
        = Word(alphas) + "," + Word(alphas) + "!"    hello = "Hello, World!"    print(hello,
        "->", greet.parseString(hello))The program outputs the following::    Hello,
        World! -> [''Hello'', '','', ''World'', ''!'']The Python representation of
        the grammar is quite readable, owing to theself-explanatory class names, and
        the use of ''+'', ''|'' and ''^'' operatordefinitions.The parsed results returned
        from ``parseString()`` is a collection of type``ParseResults``, which can
        be accessed as anested list, a dictionary, or an object with named attributes.The
        pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typicallyvexing when
        writing text parsers:- extra or missing whitespace (the above program will
        also handle ``"Hello,World!"``, ``"Hello , World !"``, etc.)- quoted strings-
        embedded commentsThe examples directory includes a simple SQL parser, simple
        CORBA IDLparser, a config file parser, a chemical formula parser, and a four-function
        algebraic notation parser, among many others.Documentation=============There
        are many examples in the online docstrings of the classesand methods in pyparsing.
        You can find them compiled into `online docs <https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
        Additionaldocumentation resources and project info are listed in the online`GitHub

        to give an idea about the power of thepackage. For more examples, look at
        the documentation.Suppose you want to know how much time is left, inyears/months/days/etc,
        before the next easter happening on ayear with a Friday 13th in August, and
        you want to get today'sdate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here
        is the code:.. code-block:: python3    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import
        *    >>> from dateutil.easter import *    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *
        \   >>> from dateutil.parser import *    >>> from datetime import *    >>>
        now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")    >>> today = now.date()    >>>
        year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year
        \   >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)    >>> print(\"Today is:
        %s\" % today)    Today is: 2003-10-11    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th
        on a Friday is: %s\" % year)    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004
        \   >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)    How
        far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)    >>> print(\"And
        the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))    And the Easter of that
        year is: 2004-04-11Being exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence

      Description: 'pytz - World Timezone Definitions for Python============================================:Author:
        Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>Introduction~~~~~~~~~~~~pytz brings
        the Olson tz database into Python. This library allowsaccurate and cross platform
        timezone calculations using Python 2.4or higher. It also solves the issue
        of ambiguous times at the endof daylight saving time, which you can read more
        about in the PythonLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).Almost all of the
        Olson timezones are supported... note::    Projects using Python 3.9 or later
        should be using the support    now included as part of the standard library,
        and third party    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.    pytz
        offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with    code written for
        earlier versions of Python... note::    This library differs from the documented
        Python API for    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock    times
        you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this    document.
        In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local    times that cross DST
        boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect    timezone (ie. subtract 1
        minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead
        of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A    ``normalize()`` method is provided
        to correct this. Unfortunately these    issues cannot be resolved without
        modifying the Python datetime    implementation (see PEP-431).Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~This
        package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using thestandard
        Python distutils.If you are installing using ``pip``, you don''t need to download
        anything as thelatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::    pip
        install pytzIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command
        as anadministrative user::    python setup.py installpytz for Enterprise~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Available
        as part of the Tidelift Subscription.The maintainers of pytz and thousands
        of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support
        and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.
        Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers
        of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.Example
        & Usage~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Localized times and date arithmetic----------------------------------->>>
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta>>> from pytz import timezone>>> import
        pytz>>> utc = pytz.utc>>> utc.zone''UTC''>>> eastern = timezone(''US/Eastern'')>>>
        eastern.zone''US/Eastern''>>> amsterdam = timezone(''Europe/Amsterdam'')>>>
        fmt = ''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z''This library only supports two ways of building
        a localized time. Thefirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by
        the pytz library.This is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with
        no timezoneinformation):>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27,
        6, 0, 0))>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500The second
        way of building a localized time is by converting an existinglocalized time
        using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)>>>
        ams_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100''Unfortunately using the
        tzinfo argument of the standard datetimeconstructors ''''does not work''''
        with pytz for many timezones.>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  #
        /!\ Does not work this way!''2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018''It is safe for
        timezones without daylight saving transitions though, suchas UTC:>>> datetime(2002,
        10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\ Not recommended except
        for UTC''2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000''The preferred way of dealing with times
        is to always work in UTC,converting to localtime only when generating output
        to be readby humans.>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)>>>
        loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:00:00
        EST-0500''This library also allows you to do date arithmetic using localtimes,
        although it is more complicated than working in UTC as youneed to use the
        ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving timeand other timezone transitions.
        In this example, ``loc_dt`` is setto the instant when daylight saving time
        ends in the US/Easterntimezone.>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)>>>
        before.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500''>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:50:00 EDT-0400''>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))>>>
        after.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500''Creating local times is
        also tricky, and the reason why working withlocal times is not recommended.
        Unfortunately, you cannot just passa ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing
        a datetime (see the nextsection for more details)>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10,
        27, 1, 30, 0)>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EDT-0400''>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EST-0500''Converting between timezones is more easily done, using
        thestandard astimezone method.>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899,
        tz=utc)>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> au_tz =
        timezone(''Australia/Sydney'')>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-27
        08:34:59 AEDT+1100''>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26
        21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2TrueYou can take shortcuts when dealing
        with the UTC side of timezoneconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()``
        are not reallynecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions
        todeal with.>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26
        21:34:59 UTC+0000''>>> au_tz = timezone(''Australia/Sydney'')>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))>>>
        au_dt.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100''>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)>>>
        utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)''2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000''``tzinfo`` API--------------The
        ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function havebeen extended
        to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``parameter to the ``utcoffset()``,
        ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.>>> tz = timezone(''America/St_Johns'')>>>
        normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)The
        ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only usedduring
        DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal,
        is_dst=True))-1 day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))1:00:00>>>
        tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)''NDT''>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))-1
        day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))1:00:00>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous,
        is_dst=True)''NDT''>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))-1 day, 21:30:00>>>
        tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds3600>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)''NDT''>>>
        print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))-1 day, 20:30:00>>> tz.dst(ambiguous,
        is_dst=False)datetime.timedelta(0)>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)''NST''If
        ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raisean ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError``
        exception.>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))-1 day, 21:30:00>>> print(tz.dst(normal))1:00:00>>>
        tz.tzname(normal)''NDT''>>> import pytz.exceptions>>> try:...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)...
        except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00>>>
        try:...     tz.dst(ambiguous)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:

        try:...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % ambiguous)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00Problems
        with Localtime~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The major problem we have to deal with
        is that certain datetimesmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern
        timezoneon the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequencehappens:    -
        01:00 EDT occurs    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned
        back 1 hour      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)In fact, every
        instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This meansthat if you try and
        create a time in the ''US/Eastern'' timezonethe standard datetime syntax,
        there is no way to specify if you meantbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time
        transition. Using thepytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated
        guess:>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))>>>
        loc_dt.strftime(fmt)''2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500''As you can see, the system
        has chosen one for you and there is a 50%chance of it being out by one hour.
        For some applications, this doesnot matter. However, if you are trying to
        schedule meetings with peoplein different timezones or analyze log files it
        is not acceptable.The best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The
        pytzpackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation byincluding
        a special UTC implementation based on the standard Pythonreference implementation
        in the Python documentation.The UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance,
        and pickles to asmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementationcan
        be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone(''UTC'').>>> import pickle,
        pytz>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)>>>
        p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)17>>>
        new = pickle.loads(p)>>> new == dtTrue>>> new is dtFalse>>> new.tzinfo is
        dt.tzinfoTrue>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone(''UTC'')TrueNote that
        some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,Greenwich, Universal,
        etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from theseother timezones, and they
        are not equivalent. For this reason, they willnot compare the same in Python.>>>
        utc == pytz.timezone(''GMT'')FalseSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.If
        you insist on working with local times, this library provides afacility for
        constructing them unambiguously:>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30,
        00)>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt,
        is_dst=False)>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + '' / '' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))2002-10-27
        01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500If you pass None as the is_dst
        flag to localize(), pytz will refuse toguess and raise exceptions if you try
        to build ambiguous or non-existenttimes.For example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002
        happened twice in the US/Easterntimezone when the clocks where put back at
        the end of Daylight SavingTime:>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)>>>
        try:...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:
        %s'' % dt)pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00Similarly,
        2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in theUS/Eastern timezone,
        as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skippingthe entire hour:>>> dt =
        datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)>>> try:...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)...
        except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:...     print(''pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:
        %s'' % dt)pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00Both of
        these exceptions share a common base class to make error handlingeasier:>>>
        isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)True>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(),
        pytz.InvalidTimeError)TrueA special case is where countries change their timezone
        definitionswith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsawswitched
        from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savingstransition.
        So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clockswere wound back
        24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannotbe specified without
        referring to the timezone abbreviation or theactual UTC offset. In this case
        midnight happened twice, neither timeduring a daylight saving time period.
        pytz handles this transition bytreating the ambiguous period before the switch
        as daylight savingstime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.>>>
        warsaw = pytz.timezone(''Europe/Warsaw'')>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915,
        8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:59:59
        WMT+0124''>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59),
        is_dst=False)>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100''>>>
        switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)>>>
        switch_dt.strftime(fmt)''1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100''>>> str(switch_dt -
        amb_dt1)''0:24:01''>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)''0:00:01''The best way of
        creating a time during an ambiguous time period isby converting from another
        timezone such as UTC:>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)>>>
        utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)''1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100''The
        standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not tohandle them,
        such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Easterntimezone definition
        from the Python documentation (Note that thisimplementation only works for
        dates between 1987 and 2006 - it isincluded for tests only!):>>> from pytz.reference
        import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10,
        27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)>>> str(dt)''2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00''>>> str(dt
        + timedelta(hours=1))''2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00''>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))''2002-10-27
        02:30:00-05:00''>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))''2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00''Notice
        the first two results? At first glance you might think they arecorrect, but
        taking the UTC offset into account you find that they areactually two hours
        appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.>>> from pytz.reference import UTC
        # pytz.reference only for tests>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))''2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00''>>>
        str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))''2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00''Country
        Information~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A mechanism is provided to access the timezones
        commonly in usefor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country
        code.It returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevanttzinfo
        instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:>>> print('' ''.join(pytz.country_timezones[''nz'']))Pacific/Auckland
        Pacific/ChathamThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English
        countryname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:>>> print(pytz.country_names[''nz''])New
        ZealandWhat is UTC~~~~~~~~~~~''UTC'' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It
        is a successor to, but distinctfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various
        definitions of UniversalTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating
        clocks and timemeasurement.All other timezones are defined relative to UTC,
        and include offsets likeUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive
        the local time. Nodaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone
        to performdate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities
        causedby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone,
        ormobile computers that roam through multiple timezones...  _Coordinated Universal
        Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_TimeHelpers~~~~~~~There
        are two lists of timezones provided.``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list
        of the timezone names that canbe used.>>> from pytz import all_timezones>>>
        len(all_timezones) >= 500True>>> ''Etc/Greenwich'' in all_timezonesTrue``common_timezones``
        is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn''tcontain deprecated zones
        or historical zones, except for a few I''vedeemed in common usage, such as
        US/Eastern (open a bug report if youthink other timezones are deserving of
        being included here). It is alsoa sequence of strings.>>> from pytz import
        common_timezones>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)True>>> ''Etc/Greenwich''
        in common_timezonesFalse>>> ''Australia/Melbourne'' in common_timezonesTrue>>>
        ''US/Eastern'' in common_timezonesTrue>>> ''Canada/Eastern'' in common_timezonesTrue>>>
        ''Australia/Yancowinna'' in all_timezonesTrue>>> ''Australia/Yancowinna''
        in common_timezonesFalseBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are
        alphabeticallysorted:>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()>>>
        common_timezones == common_timezones_dupeTrue>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]>>>
        all_timezones_dupe.sort()>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupeTrue``all_timezones``
        and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set,
        common_timezones_set>>> ''US/Eastern'' in all_timezones_setTrue>>> ''US/Eastern''
        in common_timezones_setTrue>>> ''Australia/Victoria'' in common_timezones_setFalseYou
        can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countriesusing the
        ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166two letter country
        code.>>> from pytz import country_timezones>>> print('' ''.join(country_timezones(''ch'')))Europe/Zurich>>>
        print('' ''.join(country_timezones(''CH'')))Europe/ZurichInternationalization
        - i18n/l10n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pytz is an interface to the IANA
        database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium''s Unicode Locales
        (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_project provides translations. Python packages
        such as`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_and
        Thomas Khyn''s `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be usedto
        access these translations from Python.License~~~~~~~MIT license.This code
        is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope PublicLicense,  Version
        2.1 (ZPL).I''m happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in
        otheropen source projects.Latest Versions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This package will
        be updated after releases of the Olson timezonedatabase.  The latest version
        can be downloaded from the `Python PackageIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The
        code that is usedto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and availableusing
        git::    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.gitAnnouncements of new
        releases are made on`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the`Atom
        feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_hosted there.Bugs,
        Feature Requests & Patches~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bugs should be reported
        on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.Feature requests are
        unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directedto timezone support
        now built into Python or packages that work with it.Security Issues~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Reports
        about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.Issues
        & Limitations~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects
        using Python 3.9 or later  are best served by using the timezone functionaly
        now included in core  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata
        <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the
        nearest whole minute, so timezones  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will
        be up to 30 seconds out. This  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.-
        If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can''t fix  it.
        pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and  changes
        to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.  If you find errors
        they should be reported to the time zone mailing  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.Further

        \u2013[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/)## OverviewThe `typing_extensions`
        module serves two related purposes:- Enable use of new type system features
        on older Python versions. For example,  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python
        3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows  users on previous Python versions to
        use it too.- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they
        are accepted and  added to the `typing` module.`typing_extensions` is treated
        specially by static type checkers such asmypy and pyright. Objects defined
        in `typing_extensions` are treated the sameway as equivalent forms in `typing`.`typing_extensions`
        uses[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Themajor version will be incremented
        only for backwards-incompatible changes.Therefore, it's safe to dependon `typing_extensions`
        like this: `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`,where `x.y` is the first version
        that includes all features you need.## Included itemsSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
        for acomplete listing of module contents.## ContributingSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)for
        how to contribute to `typing_extensions`."
